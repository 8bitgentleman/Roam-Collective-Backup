For example, how can you have dreams that tell you things you don't know? You think? Well, how the hell can that possibly be your coming up with the damn dream? How can the dream tell you things you don't know or analogous? Li? How can people tell stories that contain information that they don't understand?

An image. But it can't articulate it. Well, why would we be any different? We aren't obviously because we're more complex than we understand.
