        - "Is there a right approach for a person or is it dependent on circumstances? Can there be a hybrid approach which allows people to use a particular strength if necessary?"
            - There is definitely some variance on the structure of zettelkastens.
                - This likely stems from users trying to adapt an analog system into a graph database software. With technology, different workflows are possible, so there is a lot of experimentation ongoing. 
                - This is an exciting area of development and exploration  -- and an area I am keen to explore through this graph experience.
                    - On one hand, implementing a system internally for use within the [RC]([Roam-Collective](<Roam-Collective.md>))
                    - On the other, building [guidance documents]([[[How To](<[[How To.md>) Implement a Zettelkasten]]) that help others to implement a similar system.
        - "Can  [guidance documents]([[[How To](<[[How To.md>) Implement a Zettelkasten]]) be implemented in the Zettlekasten itself adding further layer of system engineering and management literature to motivate the reasons to use said systems?"
            - Interesting. Talk a  bit more about that... not sure I quite understand the idea yet.
                - "When I joined this graph, I had to explore it. I had questions, and I was answering them as I pressed on more links, opened more pages. When someone starts implementing a Zettlekasten might be prompted by the same process. Other than explanations I'd sometimes like to know why I am following a process, and said reasons are often interesting enough to be worthwhile being included as a permanent note."
                    - Ah! Yes. Gotcha now. Great idea and great explanation. 100% want that.

                                - [@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]], how would you suggest tagging project ideas ([example](((yBEHWbudk)))) in alignment with [this](((IX96gb5b6))) principle? ...
                                    - **[Related](<Related.md>):** "Process:: [creativity](<creativity.md>) [collaboration](<collaboration.md>) #[creative projects](<creative projects.md>)"
        - "[Q](<Q.md>) What is the value of recreating lists of TODOs on the Daily Note versus pulling from some central repository?"
            - Yea I like the idea of dashboards as well. In a personal graph populating in the daily note works quite well for this, but a constantly updating dashboard would likely be best in a collaborative graph. Once we have a clear vision of the components of that dashboard, it is likely quite build-able.

        - Some thoughts on [[[E:](<[[E:.md>) Evergreen Note example 1]] [@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]] [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>)
            - **[Attributes could be improved for [querying](<querying.md>) by nesting them beneath a `Tags](<Attributes could be improved for [querying](<querying.md>) by nesting them beneath a `Tags.md>):**` block. 
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FpnHw9Gjief.png?alt=media&token=2f636fa5-6549-44a7-b581-de4e3e119ebd)
            - The benefit of being able to [apply children](((zRmgBy3JB))) is not something I see value in for this graph's purposes as of yet -- but will keep this function in mind as we evolve our zettelkasten processes.
            - I still can't quite grok the value of the [E:](<E:.md>) in the title. 
                - Reason is that still use [auto-populate](<auto-populate.md>) to find evergreen notes using the E/ convention. 
                - **[And can find all evergreen notes using `#[Evergreen Notes](<Evergreen Notes.md>)` plus `Tags](<And can find all evergreen notes using `#[Evergreen Notes](<Evergreen Notes.md>)` plus `Tags.md>):**` 
                    - Or even just `#[Evergreen Notes](<Evergreen Notes.md>)` alone because as a collection tag it is only used for that purpose.
                - **Benefits I can see that I do like:**
                    - Filter a page by `[E:](<E:.md>)` to see all [evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>) on a page.
