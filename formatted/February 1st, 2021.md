        - "Is there a right approach for a person or is it dependent on circumstances? Can there be a hybrid approach which allows people to use a particular strength if necessary?"
            - There is definitely some variance on the structure of zettelkastens.
                - This likely stems from users trying to adapt an analog system into a graph database software. With technology, different workflows are possible, so there is a lot of experimentation ongoing. 
                - This is an exciting area of development and exploration  -- and an area I am keen to explore through this graph experience.
                    - On one hand, implementing a system internally for use within the [RC]([Roam-Collective](<Roam-Collective.md>))
                    - On the other, building [guidance documents]([[[How To](<[[How To.md>) Implement a Zettelkasten]]) that help others to implement a similar system.
        - "Can  [guidance documents]([[[How To](<[[How To.md>) Implement a Zettelkasten]]) be implemented in the Zettlekasten itself adding further layer of system engineering and management literature to motivate the reasons to use said systems?"
            - Interesting. Talk a  bit more about that... not sure I quite understand the idea yet.
                - "When I joined this graph, I had to explore it. I had questions, and I was answering them as I pressed on more links, opened more pages. When someone starts implementing a Zettlekasten might be prompted by the same process. Other than explanations I'd sometimes like to know why I am following a process, and said reasons are often interesting enough to be worthwhile being included as a permanent note."
                    - Ah! Yes. Gotcha now. Great idea and great explanation. 100% want that.

                                - [~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]], how would you suggest tagging project ideas ([example](((yBEHWbudk)))) in alignment with [this](((IX96gb5b6))) principle? ...
                                    - **[Related](<Related.md>):** "Process:: [creativity](<creativity.md>) [collaboration](<collaboration.md>) #[creative projects](<creative projects.md>)"
        - "[Q](<Q.md>) What is the value of recreating lists of TODOs on the Daily Note versus pulling from some central repository?"
            - Yea I like the idea of dashboards as well. In a personal graph populating in the daily note works quite well for this, but a constantly updating dashboard would likely be best in a collaborative graph. Once we have a clear vision of the components of that dashboard, it is likely quite build-able.
                - [Projects](<Projects.md>) [Ideas](<Ideas.md>) Build a productivity [dashboard](<dashboard.md>).
        - Some thoughts on [[[E:](<[[E:.md>) Evergreen Note example 1]] [~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]] [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>)
            - **[Attributes could be improved for [querying](<querying.md>) by nesting them beneath a `Tags](<Attributes could be improved for [querying](<querying.md>) by nesting them beneath a `Tags.md>):**` block. 
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FpnHw9Gjief.png?alt=media&token=2f636fa5-6549-44a7-b581-de4e3e119ebd)
            - The benefit of being able to [apply children](((zRmgBy3JB))) is not something I see value in for this graph's purposes as of yet -- but will keep this function in mind as we evolve our zettelkasten processes.
            - I still can't quite grok the value of the [E:](<E:.md>) in the title. 
                - Reason is that still use [auto-populate](<auto-populate.md>) to find evergreen notes using the E/ convention. 
                - **[And can find all evergreen notes using `#[Evergreen Notes](<Evergreen Notes.md>)` plus `Tags](<And can find all evergreen notes using `#[Evergreen Notes](<Evergreen Notes.md>)` plus `Tags.md>):**` 
                    - Or even just `#[Evergreen Notes](<Evergreen Notes.md>)` alone because as a collection tag it is only used for that purpose.
                - **Benefits I can see that I do like:**
                    - Ability to filter a page by `[E:](<E:.md>)` to see all [evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>) on a page.
                        - ^^This actually sounds quite powerful^^
                        - I built [[[E:](<[[E:.md>) Evergreen Note example 3]] to illustrate this iteration.
                - Considering: Adopt `[E:](<E:.md>)` as the [namespace]([namespaces](<namespaces.md>)) of choice, while adopting [[[E:](<[[E:.md>) Evergreen Note example 3]].

        - "[~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]], how would you suggest tagging project ideas ([example](((yBEHWbudk)))) in alignment with [this](((IX96gb5b6))) principle? ..."
            - [@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] I think you hit it on the head with the `[Projects](<Projects.md>)` + `[Ideas](<Ideas.md>)`
                - In this sense, the project is just an idea â€” perhaps once you get started, you change `[Ideas](<Ideas.md>)` to `#[In Flight](<In Flight.md>)` or some such.
                    - So, `[Ideas](<Ideas.md>)` is essentially a "state" that something can be in, and it can apply to a variety of different elements
                        - For instance, a `[Conventions](<Conventions.md>)` + `[Ideas](<Ideas.md>)` is essentially just a proposed convention or maybe even just an inkling...
                - An important component of the compound tagging approach is build some sort of aggregation page that allows users to rapidly review what exists in various stages
                    - In theory could use the `[Projects](<Projects.md>)` page to do this, adding queries for the various levels of maturity (see next block)
            - Circling back to [@[[Peter Rosso](<@[[Peter Rosso.md>)]]'s original point about using the [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) to capture "Meta" concepts, perhaps it makes sense to build some standard [maturity](<maturity.md>) scale for all elements in the graph
                - For instance: `[Ideas](<Ideas.md>)` â†’ `[InProgress](<InProgress.md>)` â†’ `[Completed](<Completed.md>)`
                    - Or: `[Fleeting](<Fleeting.md>)` â†’ `[Permanent](<Permanent.md>)`
                    - Or: `[Seedling](<Seedling.md>)` â†’ `[Budding](<Budding.md>)` â†’ `[Evergreen](<Evergreen.md>)`
                - If we use the [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) as the organizing principle for the entire graph â€” i.e., almost everything is a note (even onboarding) â€” then I think we need to work to define a how to use [collections](<collections.md>) to stitch together notes.
                    - Perhaps the [[[How To](<[[How To.md>) Onboard with Roam Collective]] could be just that...
                        - It would stitch together various notes in such a way that it would be an easily digestible repository of knowledge for new-comers...
                    - This gets to a bigger question related to the [How To](<How To.md>) pages...
                        - [Q](<Q.md>) Should [How To](<How To.md>) pages be externally focused (the product for others to consume), do we also want to use them internally (detailing the innerworkings of the Roam Collective)?
                            - The alternative would be to create some sort of internal convention the helps to detail how to jump on in (across various realms)
        - Re: "The alternative would be to create some sort of internal convention the helps to detail how to jump on in (across various realms)"
            - I'm realizing that [@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] you've probably already thought of this â€” is there a convention you've built for the purpose?
        - "Some thoughts on [[[E:](<[[E:.md>) Evergreen Note example 1]] [~[[Charles Farr](<~[[Charles Farr.md>)]] [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>)"
            - [@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]
                - "The benefit of being able to [apply children](((zRmgBy3JB))) is not something I see value in for this graph's purposes as of yet -- but will keep this function in mind as we evolve our zettelkasten processes."
                    - Yep, this makes sense â€” I came back to this point actually when thinking about it [yesterday](((VpmyBCAWV)))
                        - I was thinking that we could include multiple approaches in the [[[How To](<[[How To.md>) Implement a Zettelkasten]], even if we only use one approach to capture knowledge in our graph here...
                - "Ability to filter a page by `[E:](<E:.md>)` to see all [evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>) on a page."
                    - This is hugely powerful â€” really a big reason why it's nice to have a reference in title, because often you won't have access to the `#[Evergreen Notes](<Evergreen Notes.md>)` tag within linked references
                    - The other benefit is being able to query based on the combination of `[E:](<E:.md>)` and some topic of interest â€” for instance `[resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)`
                        - [min-con](<min-con.md>) {{[query](<query.md>): {and: [E:](<E:.md>) [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)}}}
                        - I changed the title for [[[E:](<[[E:.md>) Make evergreen notes as you write.]] to illustrate above...
                    - However, this same [query](((NrGcnTXDx))) can be accomplished using `[Evergreen Notes](<Evergreen Notes.md>)`, so perhaps a bit duplicative...
                        - [min-con](<min-con.md>) {{[query](<query.md>): {and: [Evergreen Notes](<Evergreen Notes.md>) [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)}}}
                - "Considering: Adopt `[E:](<E:.md>)` as the [namespace]([namespaces](<namespaces.md>)) of choice, while adopting [[[E:](<[[E:.md>) Evergreen Note example 3]]. "
                    - This seems like a good happy medium!
        - Hi [@[[Peter Rosso](<@[[Peter Rosso.md>)]], welcome to the RC!
            - Thinking a bit about your question here: "Is there a right approach for a person or is it dependent on circumstances? Can there be a hybrid approach which allows people to use a particular strength if necessary?"
                - I agree with what [cc:[[Brandon Toner](<cc:[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] brought up [here](((qWfyYQ5ra))) â€” there are a lot of different approaches
                    - I think that generally there are some standard best practices (such as how to nest metadata and maybe even how to create a namespace), but the final structure is likely dependent on the goals for the [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>)...
                    - The final structure will depend on:
                        - Single-player versus multiplayer
                        - Output-oriented versus memorialization-driven
                        - Level of detail required
                        - Relation to other note types (literature, fleeting, permanent, seedlings, buddings, evergreens, etc, etc, etc)
                - What I would love to do with the [[[How To](<[[How To.md>) Implement a Zettelkasten]] is to detail out
                    - Best practices to...
                        - Increase discoverability & searchability
                        - Boost [sensemaking](<sensemaking.md>) (individually or within a group)
                        - Decrease energy to contribute to a zettelkasten
                    - Structures to support various objectives
                        - Output-focused (for academic research, publishing, etc.)
                        - Learning (in classrooms, courses, etc.)
                        - Self-reflection (in tandem with journaling or some such)
                    - Some guidance on the merits of the various components, how to leverage the stock and standard conventions we (Roam Collective) lay out, and then how to remix them for a community's own purposes
