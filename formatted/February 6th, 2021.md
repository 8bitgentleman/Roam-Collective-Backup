            - **[Solution](<Solution.md>):** One naive solution to find out what to vote may be just querying out blocks created last week(or yesterday) and sorting them out using [datalog](<datalog.md>) and then manually add a slider bar to make a vote on it.

                        - First think of the topic. What is it? What type of outline are you creating?
                        - Think of active questions you may have about the topic. You don't need answers. Document the questions first, then try to answer them.

                - Does it need a tag? â€” I think so.
                - What does it uniquely collect?
                    - Acts of convergence. 
                    - Summaries

                        - Then We could use that tag to collect related ideas, leading to the eventual synthesis of the evergreen note on the subject. 
                - Hmmmm.
                - What is a community note? How is it different from an evergreen note?
