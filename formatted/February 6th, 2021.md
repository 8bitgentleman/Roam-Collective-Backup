        - A small question on Roam â€˜buttonâ€™, seems that we could type `{{}}`, it will create something like a button? So, when we click on it, it will emit a button click event? Just curious. [cc:[[Charles Farr](<cc:[[Charles Farr.md>)]] [cc:[[Brandon Toner](<cc:[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]

        - We may need a mechanism to find out **what to vote** and **how to vote** and make it visible to community members, which is one type of [activities](<activities.md>) we could try for [convergence](<convergence.md>).

            - **[Solution](<Solution.md>):** One naive solution to find out what to vote may be just querying out blocks created last week(or yesterday) and sorting them out using [datalog](<datalog.md>) and then manually add a slider bar to make a vote on it.

    - what on earth am I doing here? [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>) teleported me into this garden over a week ago, yet I only dared to dabble today
    - in an [Interintellect](<Interintellect.md>) salon today, [Matthew Vogel](<Matthew Vogel.md>) drew me back into this collective.
    - still not sure how to use the daily template, but i'm gonna start dropping thoughts.
