            3. Of the questions collected, promote some to page-status â€” making them easier to track, and creating a space for elaboration on the page contents.

            - That's why lot of research processes start with taxonomies.
            - That's why we learn numbers and letters as children. We learn sentences, and for some people those bricks become speeches and books.

            - I have some thoughts on how what you said about narrative can be observed in successful storytelling.Â  I'll add later on the graph.
            - asynchronicity is good, but synchronicity -> standing waves -> increase in product -> successful relationship (which at times are referred as in sync)

        - On organizing conversations  
            - On my mind as I logged in this morning: what did I miss? What were the important conversations about? [Q](<Q.md>) How can on get up to speed and ready to contribute in the least [costly]([cost](<cost.md>)) way possible
                - As an axiom in the back of my mind:  it's better to expedite the "catch-up time" so people can spend more time contributing instead of just organizing what is going on
                    - [@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]] what you did was so incredibly helpful!  
                        - "In my [conversation](((fPou5O8sR))) section today I went through and titled every interaction I had â€” some explicit processing"

        - On the process of collaboration
            - "#[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) [maturity](<maturity.md>), should consider the **acceptance of a term and claim among the community**, in the context of [collaboration](<collaboration.md>)."
                - This is really striking at something
                - The challenge is - how does one define acceptance of a term? 
                    - #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) [convergence](<convergence.md>) is important to the creative process but is costly / has a [transaction cost](<transaction cost.md>)
                        - This is analogous to applying heat to molecules to create structure 
                        - #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) In a collaborative environment, [cost](<cost.md>) of [convergence](<convergence.md>) scales with users
                            - It is costly to 
                                - (re: basis) have a (sufficient) basis of shared context
                                - (re: process) share mental models asynchronously 
                                - (re: outcome) align on implications

            - "That's why we learn numbers and letters as children. We learn sentences, and for some people those bricks become speeches and books."
                - Exactly!  Have more thoughts on connections to numbers specifically, will return back later in the day
