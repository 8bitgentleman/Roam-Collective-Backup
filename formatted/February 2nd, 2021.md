            - Ha! Agreed. This is a MUCH better visual experience. Well done, [@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]]

                - I've been thinking of my [future self](<future self.md>) through the use of [tagging](<tagging.md>).
                    - 1) I use [this]([[[E:](<[[E:.md>) Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]) idea as much as I can. 
                    - 2) I use the Bookmarks tag to flag things the ring particularly resonant.
                        - This helps as a filter on pages as well.

                    - I believe processes here will evolve. 
                        - I consider most content quite fleeting and try to keep the good stuff by linking and tagging to concepts or collections I know will be more likely to [resurface]([resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)).
                        - The idea of [[[E:](<[[E:.md>) active vs passive resurfacing]] is related here. [Bookmarks](<Bookmarks.md>)
                            - Within [passive resurfacing](<passive resurfacing.md>), there are strategies we can hone to improve the [probability](<probability.md>) of [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>).
                                - E.g. use of [zettelkasten](<zettelkasten.md>) notes to preserve main ideas.
                                - The questions I constantly ask myself (somewhat by second nature) is: 
                                    - "How do I want to come across this again?" 
                                    - "How important is it that I come across this again?"
                                    - "Is it time-sensitive?"

                                    - [@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]] How would you tag these types of [questions](<questions.md>)? They are more prompts, than questions, but related to a particular domain. Would you tag them as prompts?
                                        - **[Cons](<Cons.md>):**
                                            - The linked references for `[Prompts](<Prompts.md>)` can serve as a place for people to suggest prompts to be added to the main library... adding more noise may decrease the value of the linked refs there?
                                                - Could this be combatted by use of a second tag?
                                                    - Like `[Prompts](<Prompts.md>)` + `[Status](<Status.md>)/Idea` in this [example](((5XvGIEuES)))?

            - That's why lot of research processes start with taxonomies.
            - That's why we learn numbers and letters as children. We learn sentences, and for some people those bricks become speeches and books.

            - I have some thoughts on how what you said about narrative can be observed in successful storytelling.Â  I'll add later on the graph.
            - When Brandon commented made about asynchronous editing/exploration, My contrarian mind immediately thought: "What happens when the editing and exploration are synchronous?!" 
                - I think that synchronous and aligned activities in a multiplayer zettelkasten can lead to compound effects like standing waves created by signals.
                - ![Standing wave - Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Waventerference.gif/310px-Waventerference.gif)
                - When everyone is in sinch, the compound effect of alignment and synchronicity can lead to a compound output of work. Increasing both quality and quantity. Conversely, when everyone is out of sync the continuos disagreement, contradiction or misalignment in purpose can produce no perceivable result.
                    - The danger in continuous alignment is that the output is unilaterally aligned in one direction missing the inquisitive intervention of the "contrarians". This can lead to confirmation bias, creation of echo chambers and in some extent cults and collectives ðŸ˜‚
                    - e.g. Good partners, when in synch are often referred to as power couples. __"You should see y best friend and I on a good day - we are unstoppable" - Peter__
                        - The synch does not necessarily need to be in amount of output: good friends and partners are often able to push each other even when only one of the two has energy.
