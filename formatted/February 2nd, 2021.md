            1. Document [fleeting questions](<fleeting questions.md>) using `[Q](<Q.md>)`
            2. Review periodically, collecting ones that [resonate]([resonance](<resonance.md>)) or feel important to the direction of [research](<research.md>) and [development](<development.md>).
            3. Of the questions collected, promote some to page-status — making them easier to track, and creating a space for elaboration on the page contents.
