- When designing conventions within a shared Roam graph, some conventions are essential while others are "optional, but beneficial"
- This type of convention is important, because the optionality reduces the [E/barrier to entry](<../E/barrier to entry.md>) for new users and empowers a [E/low floor, high ceiling](<../E/low floor, high ceiling.md>) approach.
- Choosing not to use these sorts of conventions will not result in any meaningful disorder. Though as more users adopt and use them, it results in more [fruitful](<../fruitful.md>) [linked references](<../linked references.md>).
