- Re: "If we made complex pages like [@[[Mark Robertson](<@[[Mark Robertson.md>)]], that would work. That might be reason enough to switch conventions. DEFINITELY need a way to query for attention tags". My suggestion in this same block does work, but from what you suggest we may need to find either a JS SmartBlock or easy way to toggle read/unread.
