- #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) A community centered around [screenshot essays](<screenshot essays.md>) and a daily [writing](<writing.md>) habit, nested within the [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- The UI design [example](((lRBaD3yYL))) from [Mark Robertson](<Mark Robertson.md>) really show us the limitless possibility that what [Roam](<Roam.md>) UI can achieve. In other words, we might set our mind free first before we’re trying to implement the UI system in [Roam](<Roam.md>).

- Maybe it’s not necessarily to delete private messages actually, we could **just make it hard to find**, or hides behind the auto-complete list, but that maybe a job for [Roam](<Roam.md>) team. For us, in order to create such a space, we may insert some encoded content into [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- Maybe, we could view page as [truth](<truth.md>), in one [Roam](<Roam.md>) database, one [Roam](<Roam.md>)

- Both synchronous and async one is good. For now, I’m kind of lacking visions on how online events can be within [Roam](<Roam.md>).

- I mean, could we fulfill our online social need purely in [Roam](<Roam.md>),
