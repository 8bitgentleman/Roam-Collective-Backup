            - When referencing a prompt into the DNP, it adds a reference to the prompt.
                - I would prefer if presenting the prompts on the DNP didn't add to the block reference count. This is especially misleading when the same prompt is included in the Daily Writing Prompts for several days. ([false-positive](<false-positive.md>) for user-responses.)
