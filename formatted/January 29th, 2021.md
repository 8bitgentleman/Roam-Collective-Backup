This addresses the problem of “missing things”. If ideas are documented in zettelkasten conventions, then they are easier to rediscover through various [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>) methods.

        - "[~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] what do you think about: "Looking at all of the [SmartBlocks](<SmartBlocks.md>) in the graph and I think we need to have an approach for delineating between personal SmartBlocks (and templates) and community ones [Conventions](<Conventions.md>)""
            - Yup, really like this idea. cc: [@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]]
                - For personal naming conventions, I like `BToner` ([FLast])((reason: keeps the initials intact, so I can type BT)) or a personally designated SmartBlock user code. It doesn't really matter what it is as long as it is: [Conventions](<Conventions.md>)
                    - Easy to trigger.
                    - Unique (no conflict with another user (i.e. 2 "BT's" in the graph))
                    - Doesn't get confused with the global smartblock ("Community functions" [*](((DcXN7XPbc)))).
                        - I like the (CR) convention here. __Though that kinda feels like a name initial__ (i.e. BT)... but I think it's fine.
                        - Love [this](((pNHeT0VNp))) convention... I'm gonna adopt.
I'd also add a `.` before the `rcDNP` to `.rcDNP` to benefit in [sorting](<sorting.md>).
                            - {{[embed](<embed.md>): ((pNHeT0VNp))}}
        - "The UI/UX for such things will get complicated quickly. So having a variety of global navigation blocks or similar might be useful here [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]. You could also see an example, though not really for this exactly, here [➡️](((lRBaD3yYL)))"
            - Yea, agreed. As far as "following" goes, I'd like to keep it simple for now, and encourage others to envision how this might look logistically. 
            - My approach might be to collect some favourite topic tags, add them in relevant spots, and to rely on [passive](<passive.md>) or "[just-in-time](<just-in-time.md>)" [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>) 
        - [how-should-I-tag-this](<how-should-I-tag-this.md>) [Tensions](<Tensions.md>)

                - Is this an [evergreen note]([evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>))? Maybe. It's more a chapter title.
                    - Less of an [assertion]([assertions](<assertions.md>)), but it is a concept that I refer to periodically. 
                    - **I'm going to call it an EN**... because it's UTILITY feels similar/the same. 
        - "[~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] I would like to add the [query builder script](https://roamjs.com/docs/extensions/query-builder) to the graph"
            - Fire away! [@[[Matthew Vogel](<@[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]] 🚀, just document in the Change Log within your section (added one for you)
        - "Ok. Will this be the standard convention to NOT include inline references, but instead comment as a child to the reference?? One of the big reasons I ask is that it would then be required to open the context breadcrumbs to actually see the message that is being brought to your attention. Honestly not that big of a deal frankly. Just an observation [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]"
            - Yea, I think we'll go with nesting as standard convention for now. My strategy for navigating is to Shift-click to open the reference in the side bar, giving me easier access to the [breadcrumbs](<breadcrumbs.md>). [~[[Mark Robertson](<~[[Mark Robertson.md>)]] 
                - Definitely open to re-evaluating this over time. 
        - "I would have to say that all I would say at this moment is to allow ourselves to find the path, document the justifications/reasons for sticking with and convention and allowing others to see the justification. Though I believe you are already doing this. So let's just do it. [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]"
            - Yup, I plan to continue to leave lots of documentation/justification, thinking out loud.
            - Loving your commentary of the conventions, this type of dialogue is the path forward. 
        - "Separately, but related. How can we `@everyone` if we have the gall to do so? [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]"
            - Thought a bit about this [here](((iUKkXeJbA)))
                - Barrier to this approach is [notification management](((Ae1spW6Uo)))
            - Better solution I think is [top-section Chat](((ZlhKC6b2i))). [~[[Mark Robertson](<~[[Mark Robertson.md>)]]
        - "Another item to consider is that long discussions (with this convention) will indent very quickly, potentially leaving little to no room for readability as we move closer to the right margin. [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]. Again, organic development is probably best here, and remain flexible. "
            - My current conceptualization is to return to the level beneath the comments tag with each reply — like in this message.
            - It does get hard to re-trace for someone not a part of the original conversation, though. You'd have to go through the block refs. Which mayyyy not be too bad.
            - I agree with "Again, organic development is probably best here, and remain flexible. " [*](((H0r4ht151)))
        - "You may want to distinguish these two concepts a little bit deep first. And the distinctions themselves will become [assertions](<assertions.md>)."
            - Yup, I agree. I think the drilling down could be conducted on the [active vs passive resurfacing](<active vs passive resurfacing.md>) page itself. With more elaboration, and reference to some specific claims. [@[[leekeifon](<@[[leekeifon.md>)]]
            - Drawing some justification from this part of [Andy's Notes](<Andy's Notes.md>):
                - "I use nouns and noun phrases in note titles only to define core terms (which other notes generally orbit around). Examples: [Executable strategy](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z53fk5XwrsnueNDDCq6WNe2VbPhrDGQmmVgNS), [Enacted experience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3KASfpz5AmNmqM2m517Jbs1EvXrLN7NkeYWH), [Enabling environment](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3DaBP4vN1dutjUgrk3jbEeNxScccvDCxDgXe)"
                - I would consider [active vs passive resurfacing](<active vs passive resurfacing.md>) related to "nouns and noun-phrases"... an anchor page for more related notes to reference to.

        - The UI design [example](((lRBaD3yYL))) from [Mark Robertson](<Mark Robertson.md>) really show us the limitless possibility that what [Roam](<Roam.md>) UI can achieve. In other words, we might set our mind free first before we’re trying to implement the UI system in [Roam](<Roam.md>).
        - Maybe we could [model](<model.md>) our [Roam](<Roam.md>) [collaboration](<collaboration.md>) system with game design mindset, like a RPG game?
            - **Global public feed** that’s official way that help showing new comer what’s current trend(daily/weekly/monthly) in community.

                - maybe it becomes a work for a recommendation system, I don’t know if it’s good or not.
            - **Roaman media feed** that’s hold by an individual/a group of Roaman.
                - It’s the free choice for a Roaman decide whether or not subscribing this feed, and the content on the feed is determined by the Roaman/group of Roaman.
            - **Private communication**, should be easy to create and easy to delete.
                - Maybe it’s not necessarily to delete private messages actually, we could **just make it hard to find**, or hides behind the auto-complete list, but that maybe a job for [Roam](<Roam.md>) team. For us, in order to create such a space, we may insert some encoded content into [Roam](<Roam.md>) block which is hard to become a auto-complete candidates and then decoded it via the chatting plugin.
            - **Official event** maybe included topics that we(the whole community) want to focus on, which may need a good voting mechanism.
        - [Global public feed](((_TioVNn4W))) and [Roaman media feed](((FGNR8b-M7))) should obey [Roam publish protocol](((Mfh93O_VB))), i.e. with a `[publish](<publish.md>)` tag or some more meta-data.
