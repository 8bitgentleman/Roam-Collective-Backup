            - When referencing a prompt into the DNP, it adds a reference to the prompt.
                - I would prefer if presenting the prompts on the DNP didn't add to the block reference count. This is especially misleading when the same prompt is included in the Daily Writing Prompts for several days. ([false-positive](<false-positive.md>) for user-responses.)

        - "[~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] what do you think about: "Looking at all of the [SmartBlocks](<SmartBlocks.md>) in the graph and I think we need to have an approach for delineating between personal SmartBlocks (and templates) and community ones [Conventions](<Conventions.md>)""
            - Yup, really like this idea. cc: [@[[Charles Farr](<@[[Charles Farr.md>)]]
                - For personal naming conventions, I like `BToner` ([FLast])((reason: keeps the initials intact, so I can type BT)) or a personally designated SmartBlock user code. It doesn't really matter what it is as long as it is: [Conventions](<Conventions.md>)
                    - Easy to trigger.
                    - Unique (no conflict with another user (i.e. 2 "BT's" in the graph))
                    - Doesn't get confused with the global smartblock ("Community functions" [*](((DcXN7XPbc)))).
                        - I like the (CR) convention here. __Though that kinda feels like a name initial__ (i.e. BT)... but I think it's fine.
                        - Love [this](((pNHeT0VNp))) convention... I'm gonna adopt.
I'd also add a `.` before the `rcDNP` to `.rcDNP` to benefit in [sorting](<sorting.md>).

            - Yea, agreed. As far as "following" goes, I'd like to keep it simple for now, and encourage others to envision how this might look logistically. 
            - My approach might be to collect some favourite topic tags, add them in relevant spots, and to rely on [passive](<passive.md>) or "[just-in-time](<just-in-time.md>)" [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)

                    - Less of an [assertion]([assertions](<assertions.md>)), but it is a concept that I refer to periodically. 
                    - **I'm going to call it an EN**... because it's UTILITY feels similar/the same.

        - "Ok. Will this be the standard convention to NOT include inline references, but instead comment as a child to the reference?? One of the big reasons I ask is that it would then be required to open the context breadcrumbs to actually see the message that is being brought to your attention. Honestly not that big of a deal frankly. Just an observation [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]"
            - Yea, I think we'll go with nesting as standard convention for now. My strategy for navigating is to Shift-click to open the reference in the side bar, giving me easier access to the [breadcrumbs](<breadcrumbs.md>). [~[[Mark Robertson](<~[[Mark Robertson.md>)]]

        - The UI design [example](((lRBaD3yYL))) from [Mark Robertson](<Mark Robertson.md>) really show us the limitless possibility that what [Roam](<Roam.md>) UI can achieve. In other words, we might set our mind free first before we‚Äôre trying to implement the UI system in [Roam](<Roam.md>).
        - Maybe we could [model](<model.md>) our [Roam](<Roam.md>) [collaboration](<collaboration.md>) system with game design mindset, like a RPG game?

            - **Roaman media feed** that‚Äôs hold by an individual/a group of Roaman.
                - It‚Äôs the free choice for a Roaman decide whether or not subscribing this feed, and the content on the feed is determined by the Roaman/group of Roaman.
            - **Private communication**, should be easy to create and easy to delete.
                - Maybe it‚Äôs not necessarily to delete private messages actually, we could **just make it hard to find**, or hides behind the auto-complete list, but that maybe a job for [Roam](<Roam.md>) team. For us, in order to create such a space, we may insert some encoded content into [Roam](<Roam.md>) block which is hard to become a auto-complete candidates and then decoded it via the chatting plugin.
            - **Official event** maybe included topics that we(the whole community) want to focus on, which may need a good voting mechanism.
        - [Global public feed](((_TioVNn4W))) and [Roaman media feed](((FGNR8b-M7))) should obey [Roam publish protocol](((Mfh93O_VB))), i.e. with a `[publish](<publish.md>)` tag or some more meta-data.
