- #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>)  A shared [writing](<writing.md>) environment is an accelerator for cycles of [order](<order.md>) and [chaos](<chaos.md>) ([expansion](<expansion.md>) and [contraction](<contraction.md>)) ([divergence](<divergence.md>) and [convergence](<convergence.md>))

- #[Fleeting Notes](<Fleeting Notes.md>) A [collaborative zettelkasten](<collaborative zettelkasten.md>) helps to support [convergence](<convergence.md>)

- [Conventions](<Conventions.md>) relevant [tags](<tags.md>) should be appended to any [fleeting notes](<fleeting notes.md>) to promote effective [convergence](<convergence.md>).

- [ ] Refine a system of [convergence](<convergence.md>)

- Yup, this is definitely in my conceptual [roadmap](<roadmap.md>). I see it as [[[E:](<[[E:.md>) cycles of [divergence](<divergence.md>) and [convergence](<convergence.md>)]
