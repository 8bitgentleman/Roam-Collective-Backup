- [Q](<Q.md>) What types of [communication](<communication.md>)

## [January 28th, 2021](<January 28th, 2021.md>)
- One handy starting point to build up [communication](<communication.md>)

- But [communication](<communication.md>)

- Using the [model](<model.md>) of distributed system(i.e. each entity should have the ability to store, compute, communicate), beside [communication](<communication.md>),

- According to the [example](((yOi9SxfEw))), practically, it means that we could [model](<model.md>) the [communication](<communication.md>)

- According to the [example](((yOi9SxfEw))), practically, it means that we could [model](<model.md>) the [communication](<communication.md>) **entity, as tags or block-ref-id** and the whole [communication](<communication.md>)

- **Property** of a [communication](<communication.md>)

- **Property** of a [communication](<communication.md>) entity is **reachability**, in other words, anything in [Roam](<Roam.md>) database thatâ€™s reachable, is a valid [communication](<communication.md>)

- semantics on [communication](<communication.md>)

- **tags and block-ref-id serve as id** for [communication](<communication.md>)

- **tags and block-ref-id serve as id** for [communication](<communication.md>) entity, in other words, each block in database is a [communication](<communication.md>)
