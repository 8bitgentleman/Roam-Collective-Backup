- Really enjoyed [this exchange](((PdawSmakm))), leading to an example of how [fleeting notes](<fleeting notes.md>) can be used to build an [argument](<argument.md>) or [claim](<claim.md>).

- Could you represent an idea that you don't necessarily agree within as a fleeting note or [evergreen note]([evergreen notes](<evergreen notes.md>)), to [steel-man](<steel-man.md>) the [argument](<argument.md>) or [claim](<claim.md>)?
