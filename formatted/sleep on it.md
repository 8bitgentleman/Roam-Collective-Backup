- Within your [DNP Section](<DNP Section.md>) is perfect. The conventions are still kinda emergent for this, but I like how you did it. I see "within your DNP" as a personal log, while pinned to the top as a global log. Central might be better for visibility... will [sleep on it](<sleep on it.md>).
