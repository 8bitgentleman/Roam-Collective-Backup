- "And what I wanted to say at the [Clubhouse](<Clubhouse.md>) meetup yesterday but couldn't due to family attention, we should also create spaces in which to interact. Not necessarily required, but a space which is opened easily and closed easily, to further discuss any one topic. "Space" is hard to conceptualize in [Roam](<Roam.md>) due to its organic nature. But if you are always moving (discussing in different contexts/spaces) it will feel as if you are not really building, but shouting as you run by. I hope that makes sense. I don't know the solution either, though I have ideas. [~](<~.md>)[Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>)"

- "It's a small thing but could we could shift some of the tags and default template test to make them easier to select? Changing `[not-populated](<not-populated.md>)` to `[not_populated](<not_populated.md>)` makes it possible to select the text with a single double click in order to delete it when you're ready. [Same thing should extend to any of the 'dummy' text inside templates that's meant to be deleted.](((JCg22PlRk))) Thoughts? [~](<~.md>)[Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>)"

- "Is there discussion/dialogue convention. I see here [⬆️](((HjQ5425kF))), a convention to get your attention. Where are the standards here. I thought I saw it before you did some of the restructuring. [~](<~.md>)[Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>)"

- "What are the ideas for creating a dashboard for seeing how people are getting your attention. You can't efficiently query at this point using our conventions. If I was to create a query `{{[query](<query.md>): {and: [@](<@.md>) [Mark Robertson](<Mark Robertson.md>)}}}` I will not get my own `taps`, but instead get the ones that I have created on my DNP. The easy way, but don't know how stable is to add a `{not:}` for each member, but that seems to be an update nightmare.  [~](<~.md>)[Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>)"

- "One thing that has been clear with all the multiplayer graphs I have worked with, is that zooming in on the bullet/area you are working on CAN be helpful to allow [Roam](<Roam.md>) to more efficiently sync changes AND it eases content moving right before your eyes. - since we will in effect be on different pages, instead of on one. [~](<~.md>) [Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>)"

- "There is also a disconnect in my mind, because of the nature of this graph's purpose, between what is `[Feedback](<Feedback.md>)` and what is a `[Question](<Question.md>)`. Is there something more specific for the feedback, as in elements that are built and we have feedback on. And question would be pushing the frontiers as well as potential suggestions.

For example, many European nations (particularly Scandinavia) do not build paths through parks and open spaces UNTIL people determine what way they would want to go.

- You maybe right with your comment here: "Is this captured by this tip? [@[[Mark Robertson](<@[[Mark Robertson.md>)]] "Click on any bullet to "zoom in" for a more focused perspective (reducing the noise, and focusing on your section) - this also helps with stability if there are a lot of us writing simultaneously."" . Though I know that Zooming is under-the-hood different, from collapse. Basically collapsing is a change of state, not of page. Where if you zoom in, you are actually on another URL.
