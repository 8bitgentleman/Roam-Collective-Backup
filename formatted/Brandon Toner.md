- It's a small thing but could we could shift some of the tags and default template test to make them easier to select? Changing `[not-populated](<not-populated.md>)` to `[not_populated](<not_populated.md>)` makes it possible to select the text with a single double click in order to delete it when you're ready.

- You maybe right with your comment here: "Is this captured by this tip? [~[[Mark Robertson](<~[[Mark Robertson.md>)]] "Click on any bullet to "zoom in" for a more focused perspective (reducing the noise, and focusing on your section) - this also helps with stability if there are a lot of us writing simultaneously."" . Though I know that Zooming is under-the-hood different, from collapse. Basically collapsing is a change of state, not of page. Where if you zoom in, you are actually on another URL.
