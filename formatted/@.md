- Originally, I liked this syntax: `[@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]` (from [[[Roam Book Club](<[[Roam Book Club.md>) II]]), but I kinda like this one `[@](<@.md>)`

- The latter gives you the ability to view ALL UNREADS across the graph. Plus, you can still filter `[@](<@.md>)`

- Re: "If we made complex pages like [@[[Mark Robertson](<@[[Mark Robertson.md>)]], that would work. That might be reason enough to switch conventions. DEFINITELY need a way to query for attention tags". My suggestion in this same block does work, but from what you suggest we may need to find either a JS SmartBlock or easy way to toggle read/unread.
