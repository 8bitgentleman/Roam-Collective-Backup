## [January 27th, 2021](<January 27th, 2021.md>)
- [tags](<tags.md>) may be added inline at the end of the note or nested underneath to aid in [connection](<connection.md>) and [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>).

## [January 29th, 2021](<January 29th, 2021.md>)
- My approach might be to collect some favourite topic tags, add them in relevant spots, and to rely on [passive](<passive.md>) or "[just-in-time](<just-in-time.md>)" [resurfacing](<resurfacing.md>)

## [active vs passive resurfacing](<active vs passive resurfacing.md>)
