        - #[Roam Enhancement Requests](<Roam Enhancement Requests.md>)
            - Addition of OR operators to the page and reference [filtering](<filtering.md>).
                - Currently, it is limited to AND and NOT.
        - ""And what I wanted to say at the [Clubhouse](<Clubhouse.md>) meetup yesterday but couldn't due to family attention, we should also create spaces in which to interact. Not necessarily required, but a space which is opened easily and closed easily, to further discuss any one topic. "Space" is hard to conceptualize in [Roam](<Roam.md>) due to its organic nature. But if you are always moving (discussing in different contexts/spaces) it will feel as if you are not really building, but shouting as you run by. I hope that makes sense. I don't know the solution either, though I have ideas. [~](<~.md>)[Brandon Toner](<Brandon Toner.md>)""
            - My experience with multiplayer graphs and this specific weakness made me acutely aware of the need for non-Roam communication spaces. Chat and forum tools are a must for another layer or form of communication, and are integral to [RoamLab](<RoamLab.md>). It would be nice if we could put everything in Roam somehow, but it feels like fitting a square peg into a round hole. [~](<~.md>)[Kyle Stratis](<Kyle Stratis.md>)

                    - .... That being said... there are a TON of tags and pages missing right now, so we should hold off until things restore appropriately. 

I may have to upload the backup.

        - The concept “space” is hard to define in the context of Roam collaboration, as mentioned [here](((bIl7_WLyg))). But, the **correct public Roam collaboration space** should...
            - enable custom css setting, which maybe supported natively by Roam in the future. Currently, it’s just possible to use web-browser plugin.
                - The reason why this is important is that visual representation help lowering one’s processing work load on messy information input.
            - enable custom auto-completion list.
            - distinguish private feed and public feed.
                - Though there’s no ‘private’ in Roam database, but the idea of ‘private’ is just hiding the complexity from the public.
        - Some **concept** on Roam collaboration comes up these days...
            - Roam {X} protocol
                - **For example**, Roam publish protocol, Roam communicate protocol
                - **Explanation**: From the computer network’s perspective, all computers should obey some protocols before they can communicate. So, we need to set up a set of minimal 
            - Roam reputation system
                - This is the actual measurable reward for those members who’re producing knowledge and controlling their output complexity so that other people could find and understand his/her contents easily.
                - Soft rewards are better than restriction(?maybe) on encouraging Roamans to control the complexity of their contents when publishing.

        - [@[[Brandon Toner](<@[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] Is it valid to add tags to for ones usage(public oriented)?
            - For example, I may want to add a tag like `[experiment](<experiment.md>)` for the sake of easy query.
        - [@[[Matthew Vogel](<@[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]] So interested in your [chat plugin](((jMzfRp8cF))) mentioned yesterday. Can I join the discussion or even the implementation? Some ideas below ...
            - One of my biggest wish to the chat plugin is to be able to model the communication process with both inner-selves(i.e. Antar, an Android app) and outside world.
                - **reason** why I wanna combine inner selves chat and outside world chat as one single model is that, ...
                    - it’s achievable, as we could think of ‘I’ in different time as different person, then, the question change into async
