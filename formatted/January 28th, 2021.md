                - Steps
                    1. Anyone creates a project
                    2. They add it to the change log
                    3. They add their name as applicable
                        - {{[embed](<embed.md>): ((A57j9482B))}}
                    4. They discuss the project with teammates, community members and leaders and necessary to gain momentum on the project.
                    5. They assign attributes as applicable
                        - {{[embed](<embed.md>): ((YvnvKBKxB))}}
                    6. Ongoing commentary about the project can be nested under the project page within the [DNP Section](<DNP Section.md>)
                - [Handoffs]([handoffs](<handoffs.md>))
                    - Simply change the [project lead](((oGmvO4ycN)))
                        - This is a [query](<query.md>)-able attribute. `{{[query](<query.md>): {and: [Your Name](<Your Name.md>) [Project Lead](<Project Lead.md>)}}}`
                            - It might be even better to place the project status in the Tags line so that your could query for `{{[query](<query.md>): {and: [Status/Active](<Status/Active.md>) [Project Lead](<Project Lead.md>) [Your Name](<Your Name.md>)}}}`
                                - Project status would actually be **necessary** since you wouldn't want to see completed projects
                    - Other helpful queries
                        - "Projects I'm involved with" `{{[query](<query.md>): {and: [Status/Active](<Status/Active.md>) [Your Name](<Your Name.md>)}}}`
                - **[Notes](<Notes.md>):**
                    - This could also work well with [sprints](<sprints.md>)

        - But [communication](<communication.md>) [model](<model.md>) is not the whole point, it just serves as a component for better [collaboration](<collaboration.md>).
        - Using the [model](<model.md>) of distributed system(i.e. each entity should have the ability to store, compute, communicate), beside [communication](<communication.md>), we should also think of the [computation](<computation.md>) process. Logic inference is the important part.
    - #[Chat](<Chat.md>)
        - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] Is it valid to add tags to for ones usage(public oriented)?
            - For example, I may want to add a tag like `[experiment](<experiment.md>)` for the sake of easy query.
        - [~[[Matthew Vogel](<~[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]] So interested in your [chat plugin](((jMzfRp8cF))) mentioned yesterday. Can I join the discussion or even the implementation? Some ideas below ...
            - One of my biggest wish to the chat plugin is to be able to model the communication process with both inner-selves(i.e. Antar, an Android app) and outside world.
                - **reason** why I wanna combine inner selves chat and outside world chat as one single model is that, ...
                    - we could model **‘I’ in different time as different person**, then, the question is then transformed into **async communication with outside world**.
                    - also, take the Android app, Antar, as an example, it mainly focus on **commutation between different modes of ones own**, e.g. angry me, calm me, etc.
                    - this model maybe [Related](<Related.md>) to [spaced repetition](<spaced repetition.md>).
            - According to the [example](((yOi9SxfEw))), practically, it means that we could [model](<model.md>) the [communication](<communication.md>) **entity, as tags or block-ref-id** and the whole [communication](<communication.md>) process as **publish-subscribe model**. More explanation below. cc: [@[[Matthew Vogel](<@[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]]
                - **Property** of a [communication](<communication.md>) entity is **reachability**, in other words, anything in [Roam](<Roam.md>) database that’s reachable, is a valid [communication](<communication.md>) entity.
                - semantics on [communication](<communication.md>) entity
                    - A Roaman (e.g. [Matthew Vogel](<Matthew Vogel.md>))
                    - A group of Roamans(e.g. Roaman in [Roam Book Club](<Roam Book Club.md>))
                    - A thread in [Roam](<Roam.md>) (more explanation below)
                        - the concept, **thread**, you could think of it as **a NPC in game**, it told you the information that has already been set up in the past (i.e. sentences leaved by others)
                            - In the extreme case(maybe someday), you may not even know who’s talking in the thread.
                    - An event(i.e. activity) in [Roam](<Roam.md>)
                    - A global public feed in [Roam](<Roam.md>)
                - **tags and block-ref-id serve as id** for [communication](<communication.md>) entity, in other words, each block in database is a [communication](<communication.md>) entity.
            - Maybe one important property of inner self chat is that, we tend to achieve **consensus** across different selves, otherwise we will get mad with our own. While communication with outside world doesn’t always require this property to be hold. reply [@[[Matthew Vogel](<@[[Matthew Vogel.md>)]] on [this](((XEO7RXlX2))). #[.concept/difference](<.concept/difference.md>)

        - "And what I wanted to say at the [Clubhouse](<Clubhouse.md>) meetup yesterday but couldn't due to family attention, we should also create spaces in which to interact. Not necessarily required, but a space which is opened easily and closed easily, to further discuss any one topic. "Space" is hard to conceptualize in [Roam](<Roam.md>) due to its organic nature. But if you are always moving (discussing in different contexts/spaces) it will feel as if you are not really building, but shouting as you run by. I hope that makes sense. I don't know the solution either, though I have ideas. [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]]"
            - My experience with multiplayer graphs and this specific weakness made me acutely aware of the need for non-Roam communication spaces. Chat and forum tools are a must for another layer or form of communication, and are integral to [RoamLab](<RoamLab.md>). It would be nice if we could put everything in Roam somehow, but it feels like fitting a square peg into a round hole. [~](<~.md>)[Kyle Stratis](<Kyle Stratis.md>)

        - So weird, I can't create a new line at the first bullet level on the daily note page but I can nest bullets and create sub bullets 
        - Even if I `shift + tab` I can only do so until I get to the second level bullet. Can't go back to the top level bullet 
        - On Bookmarks convention:
            - "This is a great convention and interesting way to follow things I'm interested in. Queries for my name + bookmarks should be able to get me there. "
            - However, I will say that now it seems like there will be multiple "Akiff" pages for me to follow. Akiff Comments, Akiff Bookmarks, Akiff Saved, Akiff Mentions - could be all added into just the [Akiff Premjee](<Akiff Premjee.md>) page which seems like an interesting idea. Kind of like a personal home page with everything that I need to act on. 
            - Would even be interesting as projects go live to show everything that I have to do for a project there and that would be my home base. 
            - I like the idea of DNP for __interaction and collaboration__ and then my own personal page for updates that concern me or things I've chosen to follow. A self curated feed. 
    - [Promptstorming](<Promptstorming.md>)
        - How should we handle graph instability?
            - Two solutions:
                - hope and pray lol
                - auto-backups - I think once we can figure out a stable way to do this (which seems to be in the works or live?) we can just deal with instability as Roam builds things out

            - [^[[Brandon Toner](<^[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] this also brings up an interesting use case of __following__ a thread or a comment. I wasn't involved in the original comment but would like to be included in follow-ups or just follow peripherally. If there was something like an "AP Follow" tag that would be cool. I'm not fully involved in the conversation maybe or maybe I am but these are threads or thoughts I'd want to follow as they more fully are developed in the graph (wherever they may develop). This is not really a hand-off but more of a "more hands on or more eyeballs on" haha
        - [~[[Brandon Toner](<~[[Brandon Toner.md>)]] your Bookmarks convention got me thinking about multiple pages per person that they would have to follow and creating a kind of home base on your own personal page
            - "On Bookmarks convention:"
                - ""This is a great convention and interesting way to follow things I'm interested in. Queries for my name + bookmarks should be able to get me there. ""

        - "A cool approach to this is to filter YOUR PAGE [linked references](<linked references.md>) by Bookmarks, or any other of the [DNP Modules](<DNP Modules.md>) [Tips](<Tips.md>)"
            - Yeah but only issue with filters is that you'd have to continuously keep doing it to look through all the DNP modules. Whereas a query could persist and act as a personal dashboard of sorts and hidden under a toggle as needed
