                    - .... That being said... there are a TON of tags and pages missing right now, so we should hold off until things restore appropriately. 

I may have to upload the backup.

            - I'll draw something out on this to further clarify, but in this expression [[fleeting notes]] are NOT based on the literature, and [[literature notes]] are based on some source material. #zettelkasten #Processes #Conventions #[[Follow Up]] [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]]
                - Both could contribute to the development of [[evergreen notes]], being listed under `References` on the [[EN]] note page. (OPTIONAL)

        - The concept “space” is hard to define in the context of Roam collaboration, as mentioned [here](((bIl7_WLyg))). But, the **correct public Roam collaboration space** should...
            - enable custom css setting, which maybe supported natively by Roam in the future. Currently, it’s just possible to use web-browser plugin.
                - The reason why this is important is that visual representation help lowering one’s processing work load on messy information input.
            - enable custom auto-completion list.
            - distinguish private feed and public feed.
                - Though there’s no ‘private’ in Roam database, but the idea of ‘private’ is just hiding the complexity from the public.
        - Some **concept** on Roam collaboration comes up these days...
            - Roam {X} protocol
                - **For example**, Roam publish protocol, Roam communicate protocol
                - **Explanation**: From the computer network’s perspective, all computers should obey some protocols before they can communicate. So, we need to set up a set of minimal 
            - Roam reputation system
                - This is the actual measurable reward for those members who’re producing knowledge and controlling their output complexity so that other people could find and understand his/her contents easily.
                - Soft rewards are better than restriction(?maybe) on encouraging Roamans to control the complexity of their contents when publishing.

    - #[[Chat]]
        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] Is it valid to add tags to for ones usage(public oriented)?
            - For example, I may want to add a tag like `#experiment` for the sake of easy query.
        - [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]] So interested in your [chat plugin](((jMzfRp8cF))) mentioned yesterday. Can I join the discussion or even the implementation? Some ideas below ...
            - One of my biggest wish to the chat plugin is to be able to model the communication process with both inner-selves(i.e. Antar, an Android app) and outside world.
                - **reason** why I wanna combine inner selves chat and outside world chat as one single model is that, ...
                    - we could model **‘I’ in different time as different person**, then, the question is then transformed into **async communication with outside world**.
                    - also, take the Android app, Antar, as an example, it mainly focus on **commutation between different modes of ones own**, e.g. angry me, calm me, etc.
                    - this model maybe [[Related]] to [[spaced repetition]].

    - #Comments
        - "And what I wanted to say at the [[Clubhouse]] meetup yesterday but couldn't due to family attention, we should also create spaces in which to interact. Not necessarily required, but a space which is opened easily and closed easily, to further discuss any one topic. "Space" is hard to conceptualize in [[Roam]] due to its organic nature. But if you are always moving (discussing in different contexts/spaces) it will feel as if you are not really building, but shouting as you run by. I hope that makes sense. I don't know the solution either, though I have ideas. [[~]][[Brandon Toner]]"
            - My experience with multiplayer graphs and this specific weakness made me acutely aware of the need for non-Roam communication spaces. Chat and forum tools are a must for another layer or form of communication, and are integral to [[RoamLab]]. It would be nice if we could put everything in Roam somehow, but it feels like fitting a square peg into a round hole. [[~]][[Kyle Stratis]]

        - "With this huge surge of interest in solving the problems that us [[Roam]] users  are facing, I was having a chat with [[Bill Petro]] on [[Slack]] and the fact that we still don't have a fully functioning place to chat, engage, and archive our ideas is still pretty glaring." 
            - I have some big ideas in regards to this, I would like to share them but need to finalize a couple things. Stand by. Will let everybody know when I am at liberty to speak. [[@[[Beau Hann]]]]
