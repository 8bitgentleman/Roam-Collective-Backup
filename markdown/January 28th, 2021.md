            - Absolutely! 
                - My suggestion would be #Experiments & to make a note that you made that addition under the #[[Change Log]]
                    - .... That being said... there are a TON of tags and pages missing right now, so we should hold off until things restore appropriately. 

I may have to upload the backup.
        - "Seems like it's missing a step where [[literature notes]] inform/strengthen [[fleeting notes]] or would that happen at the [[creative projects]] phase?"
            - I'll draw something out on this to further clarify, but in this expression [[fleeting notes]] are NOT based on the literature, and [[literature notes]] are based on some source material. #zettelkasten #Processes #Conventions #[[Follow Up]] [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]]
                - Both could contribute to the development of [[evergreen notes]], being listed under `References` on the [[EN]] note page. (OPTIONAL)
                    - As indicated [here](((dhqC2IN0s))) in the template
                - Both could ALSO contribute to [[creative projects]]. Any notes within the [[zettelkasten]] can be used to support ideas within a creative project. (OPTIONAL)

        - The concept “space” is hard to define in the context of Roam collaboration, as mentioned [here](((bIl7_WLyg))). But, the **correct public Roam collaboration space** should...
            - enable custom css setting, which maybe supported natively by Roam in the future. Currently, it’s just possible to use web-browser plugin.
                - The reason why this is important is that visual representation help lowering one’s processing work load on messy information input.
            - enable custom auto-completion list.
            - distinguish private feed and public feed.
                - Though there’s no ‘private’ in Roam database, but the idea of ‘private’ is just hiding the complexity from the public.
        - Some **concept** on Roam collaboration comes up these days...
            - Roam {X} protocol
                - **For example**, Roam publish protocol, Roam communicate protocol
                - **Explanation**: From the computer network’s perspective, all computers should obey some protocols before they can communicate. So, we need to set up a set of minimal 
            - Roam reputation system
                - This is the actual measurable reward for those members who’re producing knowledge and controlling their output complexity so that other people could find and understand his/her contents easily.
                - Soft rewards are better than restriction(?maybe) on encouraging Roamans to control the complexity of their contents when publishing.

        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] Is it valid to add tags to for ones usage(public oriented)?
            - For example, I may want to add a tag like `#experiment` for the sake of easy query.
        - [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]] So interested in your [chat plugin](((jMzfRp8cF))) mentioned yesterday. Can I join the discussion or even the implementation? Some ideas below ...
            - One of my biggest wish to the chat plugin is to be able to model the communication process with both inner-selves(i.e. Antar, an Android app) and outside world.
                - **reason** why I wanna combine inner selves chat and outside world chat as one single model is that, ...
                    - we could model **‘I’ in different time as different person**, then, the question is then transformed into **async communication with outside world**.
                    - also, take the Android app, Antar, as an example, it mainly focus on **commutation between different modes of ones own**, e.g. angry me, calm me, etc.
                    - this model maybe [[Related]] to [[spaced repetition]].

            - My experience with multiplayer graphs and this specific weakness made me acutely aware of the need for non-Roam communication spaces. Chat and forum tools are a must for another layer or form of communication, and are integral to [[RoamLab]]. It would be nice if we could put everything in Roam somehow, but it feels like fitting a square peg into a round hole. [[~]][[Kyle Stratis]]
