            - [[project management]] #Processes [*]([[[[Roam Games]] Challenge 1: Project Management in a team, with handoffs]]) [*]([[projects]])
                - Steps
                    1. Anyone creates a project
                    2. They add it to the change log
                    3. They add their name as applicable
                        - {{[[embed]]: ((A57j9482B))}}
                    4. They discuss the project with teammates, community members and leaders and necessary to gain momentum on the project.
                    5. They assign attributes as applicable
                        - {{[[embed]]: ((YvnvKBKxB))}}
                    6. Ongoing commentary about the project can be nested under the project page within the [[DNP Section]]
                - [Handoffs]([[handoffs]])
                    - Simply change the [project lead](((oGmvO4ycN)))
                        - This is a [[query]]-able attribute. `{{[[query]]: {and: [[Your Name]] [[Project Lead]]}}}`
                            - It might be even better to place the project status in the Tags line so that your could query for `{{[[query]]: {and: [[Status/Active]] [[Project Lead]] [[Your Name]]}}}`
                                - Project status would actually be **necessary** since you wouldn't want to see completed projects
                    - Other helpful queries
                        - "Projects I'm involved with" `{{[[query]]: {and: [[Status/Active]] [[Your Name]]}}}`
                - Notes::
                    - This could also work well with [[sprints]]
                        - A project could be included on a sprint.
                    - What else needs to be included?
                        - Components of a project? Sub-projects?
                        - Deliverables?
                        - Milestones? 
                            - This feels more related to [[goals]]

                            - Monitored projects and tags.
                                - Would love a dashboard of tags and the number of linked references of each. With similar styling to the [[unread references]] for [[block references]]. #[[Roam Enhancement Requests]]
                                    - Click the number to see the references — hover to dismiss.
                                    - This would be great in either a list or a grid.

        - The concept “space” is hard to define in the context of Roam collaboration, as mentioned [here](((bIl7_WLyg))). But, the **correct public Roam collaboration space** should...
            - enable custom css setting, which maybe supported natively by Roam in the future. Currently, it’s just possible to use web-browser plugin.
                - The reason why this is important is that visual representation help lowering one’s processing work load on messy information input.
            - enable custom auto-completion list.
            - distinguish private feed and public feed.
                - Though there’s no ‘private’ in Roam database, but the idea of ‘private’ is just hiding the complexity from the public.
        - Some **concept** on Roam collaboration comes up these days...
            - Roam {X} protocol
                - **For example**, Roam publish protocol, Roam communicate protocol
                - **Explanation**: From the computer network’s perspective, all computers should obey some protocols before they can communicate. So, we need to set up a set of minimal 
            - Roam reputation system
                - This is the actual measurable reward for those members who’re producing knowledge and controlling their output complexity so that other people could find and understand his/her contents easily.
                - Soft rewards are better than restriction(?maybe) on encouraging Roamans to control the complexity of their contents when publishing.
        - {{[[embed]]: ((yFC7BCyMf))}}
        - {{[[embed]]: ((XT6pRAbyX))}}
        - One handy starting point to build up [[communication]] [[model]] in [[Roam]] is to adapt features from different apps(e.g. slack, twitter, whatsapp, telegram). #[[Experiments]]
        - But [[communication]] [[model]] is not the whole point, it just serves as a component for better [[collaboration]].
        - Using the [[model]] of distributed system(i.e. each entity should have the ability to store, compute, communicate), beside [[communication]], we should also think of the [[computation]] process. Logic inference is the important part.
    - #[[Chat]]
        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] Is it valid to add tags to for ones usage(public oriented)?
            - For example, I may want to add a tag like `#experiment` for the sake of easy query.
        - [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]] So interested in your [chat plugin](((jMzfRp8cF))) mentioned yesterday. Can I join the discussion or even the implementation? Some ideas below ...
            - One of my biggest wish to the chat plugin is to be able to model the communication process with both inner-selves(i.e. Antar, an Android app) and outside world.
                - **reason** why I wanna combine inner selves chat and outside world chat as one single model is that, ...
                    - we could model **‘I’ in different time as different person**, then, the question is then transformed into **async communication with outside world**.
                    - also, take the Android app, Antar, as an example, it mainly focus on **commutation between different modes of ones own**, e.g. angry me, calm me, etc.
                    - this model maybe [[Related]] to [[spaced repetition]].
            - According to the [example](((yOi9SxfEw))), practically, it means that we could [[model]] the [[communication]] **entity, as tags or block-ref-id** and the whole [[communication]] process as **publish-subscribe model**. More explanation below. cc: [[@[[Matthew Vogel]]]]
                - **Property** of a [[communication]] entity is **reachability**, in other words, anything in [[Roam]] database that’s reachable, is a valid [[communication]] entity.
                - semantics on [[communication]] entity
                    - A Roaman (e.g. [[Matthew Vogel]])
                    - A group of Roamans(e.g. Roaman in [[Roam Book Club]])
                    - A thread in [[Roam]] (more explanation below)
                        - the concept, **thread**, you could think of it as **a NPC in game**, it told you the information that has already been set up in the past (i.e. sentences leaved by others)
                            - In the extreme case(maybe someday), you may not even know who’s talking in the thread.
                    - An event(i.e. activity) in [[Roam]]
                    - A global public feed in [[Roam]]
                - **tags and block-ref-id serve as id** for [[communication]] entity, in other words, each block in database is a [[communication]] entity.
            - Maybe one important property of inner self chat is that, we tend to achieve **consensus** across different selves, otherwise we will get mad with our own. While communication with outside world doesn’t always require this property to be hold. reply [[@[[Matthew Vogel]]]] on [this](((XEO7RXlX2))). #[[.concept/difference]]
    - #[[Change Log]]
        - Add [[Experiments]] tag ((for the sake of tracking my own experiment ideas))
        - Add [[model]] tag ((for the sake of tracing typical pattern used in database))
        - Add [[computation]] page ((for the sake of discussing Roam collaboration))
- #[[My Daily Notes]] [[Kyle Stratis]] {{word-count}}
    - #Comments
        - "And what I wanted to say at the [[Clubhouse]] meetup yesterday but couldn't due to family attention, we should also create spaces in which to interact. Not necessarily required, but a space which is opened easily and closed easily, to further discuss any one topic. "Space" is hard to conceptualize in [[Roam]] due to its organic nature. But if you are always moving (discussing in different contexts/spaces) it will feel as if you are not really building, but shouting as you run by. I hope that makes sense. I don't know the solution either, though I have ideas. [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]"
            - My experience with multiplayer graphs and this specific weakness made me acutely aware of the need for non-Roam communication spaces. Chat and forum tools are a must for another layer or form of communication, and are integral to [[RoamLab]]. It would be nice if we could put everything in Roam somehow, but it feels like fitting a square peg into a round hole. [[~]][[Kyle Stratis]]

        - "With this huge surge of interest in solving the problems that us [[Roam]] users  are facing, I was having a chat with [[Bill Petro]] on [[Slack]] and the fact that we still don't have a fully functioning place to chat, engage, and archive our ideas is still pretty glaring." 
            - I have some big ideas in regards to this, I would like to share them but need to finalize a couple things. Stand by. Will let everybody know when I am at liberty to speak. [[@[[Beau Hann]]]]

    - #Scratchpad 
        - So weird, I can't create a new line at the first bullet level on the daily note page but I can nest bullets and create sub bullets 
        - Even if I `shift + tab` I can only do so until I get to the second level bullet. Can't go back to the top level bullet 
        - On Bookmarks convention:
            - "This is a great convention and interesting way to follow things I'm interested in. Queries for my name + bookmarks should be able to get me there. "
            - However, I will say that now it seems like there will be multiple "Akiff" pages for me to follow. Akiff Comments, Akiff Bookmarks, Akiff Saved, Akiff Mentions - could be all added into just the [[Akiff Premjee]] page which seems like an interesting idea. Kind of like a personal home page with everything that I need to act on. 
            - Would even be interesting as projects go live to show everything that I have to do for a project there and that would be my home base. 
            - I like the idea of DNP for __interaction and collaboration__ and then my own personal page for updates that concern me or things I've chosen to follow. A self curated feed.

        - How should we handle graph instability?
            - Two solutions:
                - hope and pray lol
                - auto-backups - I think once we can figure out a stable way to do this (which seems to be in the works or live?) we can just deal with instability as Roam builds things out

            - [[@[[Mark Robertson]]]] I'm interested to this and would like to follow. 
            - [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] this also brings up an interesting use case of __following__ a thread or a comment. I wasn't involved in the original comment but would like to be included in follow-ups or just follow peripherally. If there was something like an "AP Follow" tag that would be cool. I'm not fully involved in the conversation maybe or maybe I am but these are threads or thoughts I'd want to follow as they more fully are developed in the graph (wherever they may develop). This is not really a hand-off but more of a "more hands on or more eyeballs on" haha
        - [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] your Bookmarks convention got me thinking about multiple pages per person that they would have to follow and creating a kind of home base on your own personal page
            - "On Bookmarks convention:"
                - ""This is a great convention and interesting way to follow things I'm interested in. Queries for my name + bookmarks should be able to get me there. ""

        - "[[~[[Akiff Premjee]]]], when copying the daily prompts be aware creating a [[reference of a reference]]. You'll see it by the double orange bars. 

Resolve by "[[replace as text]]""
            - Oh interesting our CSS looks different for block references. I wonder if css is person specific? But I also didn't change anything in roam/css

        - "A cool approach to this is to filter YOUR PAGE [[linked references]] by Bookmarks, or any other of the [[DNP Modules]] #Tips"
            - Yeah but only issue with filters is that you'd have to continuously keep doing it to look through all the DNP modules. Whereas a query could persist and act as a personal dashboard of sorts and hidden under a toggle as needed
