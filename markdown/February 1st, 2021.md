        - "Is there a right approach for a person or is it dependent on circumstances? Can there be a hybrid approach which allows people to use a particular strength if necessary?"
            - There is definitely some variance on the structure of zettelkastens.
                - This likely stems from users trying to adapt an analog system into a graph database software. With technology, different workflows are possible, so there is a lot of experimentation ongoing. 
                - This is an exciting area of development and exploration  -- and an area I am keen to explore through this graph experience.
                    - On one hand, implementing a system internally for use within the [RC]([[Roam-Collective]])
                    - On the other, building [guidance documents]([[[[How To]] Implement a Zettelkasten]]) that help others to implement a similar system.
        - "Can  [guidance documents]([[[[How To]] Implement a Zettelkasten]]) be implemented in the Zettlekasten itself adding further layer of system engineering and management literature to motivate the reasons to use said systems?"
            - Interesting. Talk a  bit more about that... not sure I quite understand the idea yet.
                - "When I joined this graph, I had to explore it. I had questions, and I was answering them as I pressed on more links, opened more pages. When someone starts implementing a Zettlekasten might be prompted by the same process. Other than explanations I'd sometimes like to know why I am following a process, and said reasons are often interesting enough to be worthwhile being included as a permanent note."
                    - Ah! Yes. Gotcha now. Great idea and great explanation. 100% want that.
                        - {{[[TODO]]}} Develop evergreen notes on the purpose and potential of a (collaborative) [[zettelkasten]]. #[[February 2021]] #[[Help Wanted]]
                            - Work these into an outline, then writeup on the **reason** for pursuing a zettelkasten in a collaborative graph. #Projects #Ideas
                                - [[@[[Charles Farr]]]], how would you suggest tagging project ideas ([example](((yBEHWbudk)))) in alignment with [this](((IX96gb5b6))) principle? ...
                                    - Related:: "Process:: #creativity #collaboration #[[creative projects]]"
        - "#Q What is the value of recreating lists of TODOs on the Daily Note versus pulling from some central repository?"
            - Yea I like the idea of dashboards as well. In a personal graph populating in the daily note works quite well for this, but a constantly updating dashboard would likely be best in a collaborative graph. Once we have a clear vision of the components of that dashboard, it is likely quite build-able.
                - #Projects #Ideas Build a productivity [[dashboard]].
        - Some thoughts on [[[[E:]] Evergreen Note example 1]] [[@[[Charles Farr]]]] #zettelkasten
            - Attributes could be improved for [[querying]] by nesting them beneath a `Tags::` block. 
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FpnHw9Gjief.png?alt=media&token=2f636fa5-6549-44a7-b581-de4e3e119ebd)
            - The benefit of being able to [apply children](((zRmgBy3JB))) is not something I see value in for this graph's purposes as of yet -- but will keep this function in mind as we evolve our zettelkasten processes.
            - I still can't quite grok the value of the [[E:]] in the title. 
                - Reason is that still use [[auto-populate]] to find evergreen notes using the E/ convention. 
                - And can find all evergreen notes using `#[[Evergreen Notes]]` plus `Tags::` 
                    - Or even just `#[[Evergreen Notes]]` alone because as a collection tag it is only used for that purpose.
                - **Benefits I can see that I do like:**
                    - Filter a page by `[[E:]]` to see all [[evergreen notes]] on a page.

            - "Selecting the right approach"
                - Is there a right approach for a person or is it dependent on circumstances? Can there be a hybrid approach which allows people to use a particular strength if necessary?
            - Should we have conventions on how we use nested squared brackets? `[[[[prefix-]][[main]][[-suffix]]]]` 
`[[How to]]` would be considered a prefix-
