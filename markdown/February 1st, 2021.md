- #[[My Daily Notes]] [[Brandon Toner]] {{word-count}}
    - #[[Scratchpad]] 
        - #Observations
            - Having more fun writing in [[Roam-Collective]] than my my own graph lately ðŸ˜‚
                - Seeing some of the ideas and conventions surfaced here spilling into my personal systems.
                    - Taking literature notes for some lectures last night was an ABSOLUTE PLEASURE!
                - It's been particularly interesting to me the level of [[flow state]] writing I've been able to tap into writing in here. 
                    - I think it has to do with the constant potential for interaction and commentary, paired with seeing the contributions of others. 
                        - There always seems to be something to write, comment on, or build. Definitely a [[fly wheel]] effect at play.
    - #GTD #not_populated
    - #[[Change Log]] #not_populated
    - #[[The Zettelkasten]] #not_populated
    - #Conversation 
        - "Is there a right approach for a person or is it dependent on circumstances? Can there be a hybrid approach which allows people to use a particular strength if necessary?"
            - There is definitely some variance on the structure of zettelkastens.
                - This likely stems from users trying to adapt an analog system into a graph database software. With technology, different workflows are possible, so there is a lot of experimentation ongoing. 
                - This is an exciting area of development and exploration  -- and an area I am keen to explore through this graph experience.
                    - On one hand, implementing a system internally for use within the [RC]([[Roam-Collective]])
                    - On the other, building [guidance documents]([[[[How To]] Implement a Zettelkasten]]) that help others to implement a similar system.
        - "Can  [guidance documents]([[[[How To]] Implement a Zettelkasten]]) be implemented in the Zettlekasten itself adding further layer of system engineering and management literature to motivate the reasons to use said systems?"
            - Interesting. Talk a  bit more about that... not sure I quite understand the idea yet.
                - "When I joined this graph, I had to explore it. I had questions, and I was answering them as I pressed on more links, opened more pages. When someone starts implementing a Zettlekasten might be prompted by the same process. Other than explanations I'd sometimes like to know why I am following a process, and said reasons are often interesting enough to be worthwhile being included as a permanent note."
                    - Ah! Yes. Gotcha now. Great idea and great explanation. 100% want that.
                        - {{[[TODO]]}} Develop evergreen notes on the purpose and potential of a (collaborative) [[zettelkasten]]. #[[February 2021]] #[[Help Wanted]]
                            - Work these into an outline, then writeup on the **reason** for pursuing a zettelkasten in a collaborative graph. #Projects #Ideas
                                - [[~[[Charles Farr]]]], how would you suggest tagging project ideas ([example](((yBEHWbudk)))) in alignment with [this](((IX96gb5b6))) principle? ...
                                    - Related:: "Process:: #creativity #collaboration #[[creative projects]]"
        - "#Q What is the value of recreating lists of TODOs on the Daily Note versus pulling from some central repository?"
            - Yea I like the idea of dashboards as well. In a personal graph populating in the daily note works quite well for this, but a constantly updating dashboard would likely be best in a collaborative graph. Once we have a clear vision of the components of that dashboard, it is likely quite build-able.
                - #Projects #Ideas Build a productivity [[dashboard]].
        - Some thoughts on [[[[E:]] Evergreen Note example 1]] [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] #zettelkasten
            - Attributes could be improved for [[querying]] by nesting them beneath a `Tags::` block. 
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FpnHw9Gjief.png?alt=media&token=2f636fa5-6549-44a7-b581-de4e3e119ebd)
            - The benefit of being able to [apply children](((zRmgBy3JB))) is not something I see value in for this graph's purposes as of yet -- but will keep this function in mind as we evolve our zettelkasten processes.
            - I still can't quite grok the value of the [[E:]] in the title. 
                - Reason is that still use [[auto-populate]] to find evergreen notes using the E/ convention. 
                - And can find all evergreen notes using `#[[Evergreen Notes]]` plus `Tags::` 
                    - Or even just `#[[Evergreen Notes]]` alone because as a collection tag it is only used for that purpose.
                - **Benefits I can see that I do like:**
                    - Ability to filter a page by `[[E:]]` to see all [[evergreen notes]] on a page.
                        - ^^This actually sounds quite powerful^^
                        - I built [[[[E:]] Evergreen Note example 3]] to illustrate this iteration.
                - Considering: Adopt `[[E:]]` as the [namespace]([[namespaces]]) of choice, while adopting [[[[E:]] Evergreen Note example 3]].

                        - "{{[[TODO]]}} [[Choice]]: For [[evergreen notes]], what should the [[namespaces]] be? ((((cv2ny1Xe-)))) "
        - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] I'm personally not a fan of making this the default since the CSS will override whatever user preference is set but since [you asked](((UTsXd_3pp))) here's how"
            - Yea, I have the same feelings about it....
                - I think no-brackets works best with the nested pages CSS and cuts a lot of noise, but that might not be universal user preference.
                    - I'd opt to keep it a user preference, and see if it becomes annoying to those new to the graph. - Thanks for finding that!
                        - What are your thoughts? [[~[[Matthew Vogel]]]]
                            - Another option might be to make that a step in the "[[Quick Start Guide]]'"
                                - Agreed [*](((Sh32I3JAi)))

                    - When I joined this graph, I had to explore it. I had questions, and I was answering them as I pressed on more links, opened more pages. When someone starts implementing a Zettlekasten might be prompted by the same process. Other than explanations I'd sometimes like to know why I am following a process, and said reasons are often interesting enough to be worthwhile being included as a permanent note.
        - "Hi [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]], welcome to the RC!"
            - Thanks [[@[[Charles Farr]]]] loving how  conversations are continuously iterated and resurfaced in the setup we have for conversations.
            - Regarding "Reflection on any of the [[How To]] pages [[Charles Farr]] has developed. (these are for the purpose of assisting others in setting up a shared graph like this one. They are all related to [[[[How To]] Seed Your Graph]])"
                 I was wondering if we should we have conventions on how we use nested squared brackets? `[[[[prefix-]][[main]][[-suffix]]]]` 
`[[How to]]` would be considered a prefix-
                My graph is currently responding properly, thus I might not be able to upload an example, but I am currently using the `[[main[[-suffix]]]]` in my Zettelkasten. I am using the same system that Beau Hann showed in a video on Robert Haisfield's youtube channel.  
                    What I realised is that I often have reference stuff in academic papers, thus some permanent notes have use the suffix as a link to the bibliographical page I have on my graph. 
        - "Circling back to [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]]'s original point about using the [[zettelkasten]] to capture "Meta" concepts, perhaps it makes sense to build some standard [[maturity]] scale for all elements in the graph"
            - [[@[[Charles Farr]]]] Isn't the idea reinforced in [[Books/How to Take Smart Notes]] that permanent notes should always be completed, but they can be updated?  
            - If we were concerned to see how fleeting conversation ended up becoming a permanent note there are different considerations to to make:
                - Fleeting notes should be fleeting, thus we should not be concerned with them.
                - If we were still concerned with them, should these notes be promoted at least to literature notes?
                - Is this going to promote a good process or information hoarding?
            - "Fleeting notes should be fleeting, thus we should not be concerned with them." and "Is this going to promote a good process or information hoarding?" beg the question. Are an excess of fleeting notes going to slow down this graph and if that's the case should we have revisions which aim to purge fleeting notes?
            - One thing I definitely I agree is that we need clear systems which would incentivize clear and unburdened thinking.  According to the book "the motivation myth" systems are the true way forward.
        - "https://twitter.com/brandontoner/status/1353493176296894464?s=21"
            - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] This idea goes hand in hand with the idea of double diamond in engineering design and product development.
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FdlGzsQA9E5.png?alt=media&token=1f34e98d-e688-4e4c-8ad7-f6609bfc2547)
                - I like to think that the first phase is the Zettlekasten phase, while the second phase is the output phase.

        - "[[~[[Charles Farr]]]], how would you suggest tagging project ideas ([example](((yBEHWbudk)))) in alignment with [this](((IX96gb5b6))) principle? ..."
            - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] I think you hit it on the head with the `#Projects` + `#Ideas`
                - In this sense, the project is just an idea â€” perhaps once you get started, you change `#Ideas` to `#[[In Flight]]` or some such.
                    - So, `#Ideas` is essentially a "state" that something can be in, and it can apply to a variety of different elements
                        - For instance, a `#Conventions` + `#Ideas` is essentially just a proposed convention or maybe even just an inkling...
                - An important component of the compound tagging approach is build some sort of aggregation page that allows users to rapidly review what exists in various stages
                    - In theory could use the `[[Projects]]` page to do this, adding queries for the various levels of maturity (see next block)
            - Circling back to [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]]'s original point about using the [[zettelkasten]] to capture "Meta" concepts, perhaps it makes sense to build some standard [[maturity]] scale for all elements in the graph
                - For instance: `#Ideas` â†’ `#InProgress` â†’ `#Completed`
                    - Or: `#Fleeting` â†’ `#Permanent`
                    - Or: `#Seedling` â†’ `#Budding` â†’ `#Evergreen`
                - If we use the [[zettelkasten]] as the organizing principle for the entire graph â€” i.e., almost everything is a note (even onboarding) â€” then I think we need to work to define a how to use [[collections]] to stitch together notes.
                    - Perhaps the [[[[How To]] Onboard with Roam Collective]] could be just that...
                        - It would stitch together various notes in such a way that it would be an easily digestible repository of knowledge for new-comers...
                    - This gets to a bigger question related to the [[How To]] pages...
                        - #Q Should [[How To]] pages be externally focused (the product for others to consume), do we also want to use them internally (detailing the innerworkings of the Roam Collective)?
                            - The alternative would be to create some sort of internal convention the helps to detail how to jump on in (across various realms)
        - Re: "The alternative would be to create some sort of internal convention the helps to detail how to jump on in (across various realms)"
            - I'm realizing that [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] you've probably already thought of this â€” is there a convention you've built for the purpose?
        - "Some thoughts on [[[[E:]] Evergreen Note example 1]] [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] #zettelkasten"
            - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]]
                - "The benefit of being able to [apply children](((zRmgBy3JB))) is not something I see value in for this graph's purposes as of yet -- but will keep this function in mind as we evolve our zettelkasten processes."
                    - Yep, this makes sense â€” I came back to this point actually when thinking about it [yesterday](((VpmyBCAWV)))
                        - I was thinking that we could include multiple approaches in the [[[[How To]] Implement a Zettelkasten]], even if we only use one approach to capture knowledge in our graph here...
                - "Ability to filter a page by `[[E:]]` to see all [[evergreen notes]] on a page."
                    - This is hugely powerful â€” really a big reason why it's nice to have a reference in title, because often you won't have access to the `#[[Evergreen Notes]]` tag within linked references
                    - The other benefit is being able to query based on the combination of `[[E:]]` and some topic of interest â€” for instance `[[resurfacing]]`
                        - #min-con {{[[query]]: {and: [[E:]] [[resurfacing]]}}}
                        - I changed the title for [[[[E:]] Make evergreen notes as you write.]] to illustrate above...
                    - However, this same [query](((NrGcnTXDx))) can be accomplished using `[[Evergreen Notes]]`, so perhaps a bit duplicative...
                        - #min-con {{[[query]]: {and: [[Evergreen Notes]] [[resurfacing]]}}}
                - "Considering: Adopt `[[E:]]` as the [namespace]([[namespaces]]) of choice, while adopting [[[[E:]] Evergreen Note example 3]]. "
                    - This seems like a good happy medium!
        - Hi [[~[[Peter Rosso]]]], welcome to the RC!
            - Thinking a bit about your question here: "Is there a right approach for a person or is it dependent on circumstances? Can there be a hybrid approach which allows people to use a particular strength if necessary?"
                - I agree with what [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]] brought up [here](((qWfyYQ5ra))) â€” there are a lot of different approaches
                    - I think that generally there are some standard best practices (such as how to nest metadata and maybe even how to create a namespace), but the final structure is likely dependent on the goals for the [[zettelkasten]]...
                    - The final structure will depend on:
                        - Single-player versus multiplayer
                        - Output-oriented versus memorialization-driven
                        - Level of detail required
                        - Relation to other note types (literature, fleeting, permanent, seedlings, buddings, evergreens, etc, etc, etc)
                - What I would love to do with the [[[[How To]] Implement a Zettelkasten]] is to detail out
                    - Best practices to...
                        - Increase discoverability & searchability
                        - Boost [[sensemaking]] (individually or within a group)
                        - Decrease energy to contribute to a zettelkasten
                    - Structures to support various objectives
                        - Output-focused (for academic research, publishing, etc.)
                        - Learning (in classrooms, courses, etc.)
                        - Self-reflection (in tandem with journaling or some such)
                    - Some guidance on the merits of the various components, how to leverage the stock and standard conventions we (Roam Collective) lay out, and then how to remix them for a community's own purposes

I'm not aware of a way to change user preferences and even if there was one it would be JS and need to be enabled by the user which defeats the purpose. I'd say adding it to the [[Quick Start Guide]] as a suggestion is the most democratic solution.
