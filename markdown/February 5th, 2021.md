        - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] We can start [setting up the website](((m-bFHWp73))) either using a service like wordpress/squareplace or building one and hosting it on https://app.netlify.com/ for a start.
            - Ideally, it would be nice to be able to use specific pages in the graph as a way to publish blog posts on the website.
    - #GTD 
        - Order old tasks by priority
        - "Let's get started on this here: [[Weekly Review: Graph Seed â€” February 4, 2020]]"
        - reply "Also, l love the idea of making it a [[synchronous]] activity â€” let's all hop on Zoom or Clubhouse soon."

        - I love [[@[[Charles Farr]]]]'s idea of [specific tags](((cfEfYDOAh))) `#Broadcast / #Radio / #Vote` resurfacing using smart blocks. I wish [status flag](((hj8c8eDin))) could be set using drop down menu. That way we are sure that people always set a status.  â€” cc: [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[@[[leekeifon]]]] [[@[[Larissa de Lima]]]]
        - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] Damn, I should have [checked](((uQo0I4CWK))). Did you try to ask anyone at Roam?
        - [[@[[Matthew Vogel]]]] Can [live preview](((Ue69JZ6i5))) be used only on specific blocks/pages? e.g. only on evergreen notes?
        - [[@[[leekeifon]]]] and that is [very clear definition](((1dcTvgxys))) that for some reason I missed - rereading your thoughts today, sorry!
