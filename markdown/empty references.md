- Tags:: #Glossary
- They can noisy-up the graph and make it harder to separate [[signal]] from noise.
- Attributes or tags that are intended to have content, but don't have any content populated. 
- Solutions::
    - Use a `#not_populated` tag and use it to filter selections
    - Be mindful to delete references generated by [[SmartBlocks]] that do not have commentary or annotations added to them.
    - Use [[inline code-blocks]] to deactivate a tag when using them for demonstration or while discussing conventions.
