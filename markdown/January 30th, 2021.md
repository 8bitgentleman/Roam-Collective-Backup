                    - "they're five or six. They're playing marbles. You take them out of the game and you say Okay, tell me the rules of the game of marbles. They give incoherent representations. Why? Because their behavior is more sophisticated than their representation. You see, a soon as you understand that that is a wild thing to understand because it answers the question. For example, how can you have dreams that tell you things you don't know? You think? Well, how the hell can that possibly be your coming up with the damn dream? How can the dream tell you things you don't know or analogous? Li? How can people tell stories that contain information that they don't understand? And the answer is that information is coded in our behavior." [*](((4tOaJgC_b)))
                    - "All the chimpanzees in the troop know the dominance hierarchy structure. But if you take a chimpanzee out from the truth and say, What's the dominant structure? The chimpanzee is gonna do whatever chimpanzee does, it's not gonna have a little conversation with you about the nature of the dominance hierarchy so it can act out its knowledge, and it might even be able to represent it. An image. But it can't articulate it. Well, why would we be any different? We aren't obviously because we're more complex than we understand. So the fact that we're more complex than we understand means that we contain information that we cannot articulate." [*](((4tOaJgC_b)))

                    - "you go before the judiciary, you sort out the dispute. That becomes a precedent now. That's part of the body of laws. **The body of laws is what you act out.** That's why it's a body. Well, that's what Moses does. So he's sitting there making judgments very, very finely tuned. Discreet moral judgments." [*](((ugYN_NZgf)))
                    - "So he walks through this entire process of continual judicial intermediation. Then he goes up the mountain. And what does he get? Tablet of Rules? Well, why? __Well, he spent his 10,000 hours investigating the structure of morality in a practical way__, and it goes, bang. This is what we've been doing. These are the rules. ^^It's not like there's no rules to begin with and those are imposed because that wouldn't work. It doesn't work that way. You have to take how people are extract out what the pattern of what they are is reflect that back to them.^^ Well, that's that's the story of [[Moses]] and it's a [[myth]]. It's a [[meta story]]. It's **It's a story about how rules come to be.**" [*](((ugYN_NZgf)))

                        - But once they emerge, they become distributed — they transmute into other related forms. They become shared rules for social engagement and order. 
                        - What determines when [[structure]] should be crystallized into [[law]] or [[conventions]]?
                            - "Crystallized" is intended to be [[held lightly]] here. 
                                - But degree of crystallization is another interesting question. How firm should we hold [[structure]]?

        1. [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]do you have a tag already created that you use similarly? If so, we should merge them... 
        1. "Perhaps this is a great place to use some of the rhetoric arguments we were thinking about defining... [[~[[Charles Farr]]]]"
            - Agree [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] — any thoughts on areas of thought we should research to help build out this stucture?
                - Some ideas
                    - Mathematical proofs
                    - Logic
                    - Rhetorical arguments
                    - Debate
        2. "Yup, really like this idea. cc: [[~[[Charles Farr]]]]"
            - Sounds good [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] — going to update all of the current SmartBlocks in the graph at some point today. Will note in the change log.
