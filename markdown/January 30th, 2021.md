                    - "they're five or six. They're playing marbles. You take them out of the game and you say Okay, tell me the rules of the game of marbles. They give incoherent representations. Why? Because their behavior is more sophisticated than their representation. You see, a soon as you understand that that is a wild thing to understand because it answers the question. For example, how can you have dreams that tell you things you don't know? You think? Well, how the hell can that possibly be your coming up with the damn dream? How can the dream tell you things you don't know or analogous? Li? How can people tell stories that contain information that they don't understand? And the answer is that information is coded in our behavior." [*](((4tOaJgC_b)))

The chimpanzee is gonna do whatever chimpanzee does, it's not gonna have a little conversation with you about the nature of the dominance hierarchy so it can act out its knowledge, and it might even be able to represent it. An image. But it can't articulate it. Well, why would we be any different? We aren't obviously because we're more complex than we understand. So the fact that we're more complex than we understand means that we contain information that we cannot articulate." [*](((4tOaJgC_b)))

Well, why? __Well, he spent his 10,000 hours investigating the structure of morality in a practical way__, and it goes, bang. This is what we've been doing. These are the rules. ^^It's not like there's no rules to begin with and those are imposed because that wouldn't work. It doesn't work that way. You have to take how people are extract out what the pattern of what they are is reflect that back to them.^^ Well, that's that's the story of [[Moses]] and it's a [[myth]]. It's a [[meta story]].

            - Some live events to drive some interest and activity.
            - A shared project to collaboratively work towards.
            - More emphasis and training on the collective zettelkasten systems.
