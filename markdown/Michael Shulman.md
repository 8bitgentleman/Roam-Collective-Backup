        - I'm a 5th year PhD student at [[George Mason University]], in [[Fairfax]] [[Virginia]]. I've been studying [[teams]] and [[multiteam systems]], and have grown fascinated by the synergy between tech and us. 
            - This is why I'm fascinated by what's being done in collaborative Roam. I'm coming from the [[psychology]] side, and currently working to present the psych field with a good overview of how to think about tech, and to include how the tech world might think about the [[teamwork processes]] studied in psych - how they are helped and challenged by various aspects of tech. 
        - I started using [[Roam]] in [[February 2020]]
            - Other tools I'd have a hard time living without, or that there aren't good substitutes for: [[DEVONthink]] [[Amazing Marvin]] [[Liquid Text]]
        - Interests:: [[tools for thought]] [[teamwork]] [[music]] [[photography]] [[singing]] [[reading]] [[cars]]
