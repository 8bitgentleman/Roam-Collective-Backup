- Ok, here's a breakdown of the types of questions:
    - Questions:: Requests for guidance. Tag someone in these to get their attention.
    - Open Questions:: More big picture, related to the domain we're trying to navigate
    - Context Questions:: Similar to open questions, but unable to stand-alone. Often placed in context as a response to something. More auto-socratic is utilization.
