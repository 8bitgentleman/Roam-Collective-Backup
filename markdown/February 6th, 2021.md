        - I upvote this section "[[datalog]] flashcards"! [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]]
        - We may need a mechanism to find out **what to vote** and **how to vote** and make it visible to community members, which is one type of [[activities]] we could try for [[convergence]]. [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] [[cc:[[Peter Rosso]]]] [[cc:[[Larissa de Lima]]]]
            - Solution:: One naive solution to find out what to vote may be just querying out blocks created last week(or yesterday) and sorting them out using [[datalog]] and then manually add a slider bar to make a vote on it.
