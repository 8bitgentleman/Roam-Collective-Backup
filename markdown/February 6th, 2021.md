        - A small question on Roam â€˜buttonâ€™, seems that we could type `{{}}`, it will create something like a button? So, when we click on it, it will emit a button click event? Just curious. [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]]
    - #[[Conversation]]
        - I upvote this section "[[datalog]] flashcards"! [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]]
        - We may need a mechanism to find out **what to vote** and **how to vote** and make it visible to community members, which is one type of [[activities]] we could try for [[convergence]]. [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] [[cc:[[Peter Rosso]]]] [[cc:[[Larissa de Lima]]]]
            - Solution:: One naive solution to find out what to vote may be just querying out blocks created last week(or yesterday) and sorting them out using [[datalog]] and then manually add a slider bar to make a vote on it.

    - what on earth am I doing here? [[Brandon Toner]] teleported me into this garden over a week ago, yet I only dared to dabble today
    - in an [[Interintellect]] salon today, [[Matthew Vogel]] drew me back into this collective.
    - still not sure how to use the daily template, but i'm gonna start dropping thoughts.

        - Today's [[Clubhouse]] session with [[Robert Haisfield]], [[cc:[[Mark Robertson]]]], [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]] and many more was very interesting. I learned a lot about the future of [[Roam]], [[Roam42]], and how the mood in the community. I listened to the conversation for more than ~2+ hours.

        - On [[proximity]] and [[synthesis]].
            - Ideas start small and grow. 
            - Meet your thoughts at the level of [[granularity]] that feels clear to you.
            - Capture thoughts as they arise.
            - Over time, gather the similar pieces together. 
            - Assess the similar pieces for patterns. Document those patterns as they become apparent. 
            - Convergence on one set of ideas, may lead to divergence on another. 
            - Having a destination or goal in mind, helps to drive the direction of development. 
            - Community goals
            - Active topics.
            - Write non-linearly. Capture the pieces, figure out the order later.

                    - Group members can reference an element in an outline to elaborate on, providing content that can eventually be used to develop a draft of the intended writing project.

                - "#Q How are [[speculative outlines]] documented?"
                    - [[speculative outlines]] can be created in several ways:
                        - First think of the topic. What is it? What type of outline are you creating?
                        - Think of active questions you may have about the topic. You don't need answers. Document the questions first, then try to answer them.

            - Great question. Gonna think on this! [[@[[Charles Farr]]]]
                - Does it need a tag? â€” I think so.
                - What does it uniquely collect?
                    - Acts of convergence. 
                    - Summaries
                    - Curations
                    - Collections of ideas.
                - Maybe it's a "[creative project]([[creative projects]])"...
                    - "Projects/Summarize ideas on note maturity"
                        - Then We could use that tag to collect related ideas, leading to the eventual synthesis of the evergreen note on the subject. 
                - Hmmmm.
                - What is a community note? How is it different from an evergreen note?
