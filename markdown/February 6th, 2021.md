        - A small question on Roam â€˜buttonâ€™, seems that we could type `{{}}`, it will create something like a button? So, when we click on it, it will emit a button click event? Just curious. [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]]
    - #[[Conversation]]
        - I upvote this section "[[datalog]] flashcards"! [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]]
        - We may need a mechanism to find out **what to vote** and **how to vote** and make it visible to community members, which is one type of [[activities]] we could try for [[convergence]]. [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] [[cc:[[Peter Rosso]]]] [[cc:[[Larissa de Lima]]]]
            - Solution:: One naive solution to find out what to vote may be just querying out blocks created last week(or yesterday) and sorting them out using [[datalog]] and then manually add a slider bar to make a vote on it.

    - what on earth am I doing here? [[Brandon Toner]] teleported me into this garden over a week ago, yet I only dared to dabble today
    - in an [[Interintellect]] salon today, [[Matthew Vogel]] drew me back into this collective.
    - still not sure how to use the daily template, but i'm gonna start dropping thoughts.
