- Using the `#[[My Daily Notes]]` tag #Processes
    - When writing on the daily page, type `#[[My Daily Notes]]` followed by your page. 
    - Nest all of your notes under that block.
    - **Optional**: Use some of the other tags to further organize your thoughts. 
        - Using these other tags is not necessary, but helps to better compile information for filtering and querying. 
    - #Tips
        - Use the [default template](((qONZuXh3Y))) or build your own to make populating your DNP section easier. 
        - Use `#not-populated` in your template to avoid creating [[empty attributes]]
    - Example::
        - This example is QUITE developed. You could simply nest your ideas underneath the `#[[My Daily Notes]]` header â€” without organization under other tags. 

As you get comfortable with the available tags, I'd recommend using them to help with data navigation and compilation.
