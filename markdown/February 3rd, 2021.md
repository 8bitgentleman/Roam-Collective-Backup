            - This is a common problem in research groups. We follow the double diamond structure in setting up our work, and my thesis is set up to follow the same structure too. The moments of output are dictated by deadlines and the fact that output determines grants.

        - What is the parallel between the RC and the MIT provisional building mentioned in Deep work? 
        - ">  ...itâ€™s worth pointing out that the Hindu-Arabic numerals arenâ€™t just an extraordinary piece of design. Theyâ€™re also an extraordinary mathematical insight. They involve many non-obvious ideas, if all you know is Roman numerals. Perhaps most remarkably, the meaning of a numeral actuallyÂ __changes__, depending on its position within a number. Also remarkable, consider that when we add the numbers 72 and 83 we at some point will likely use 2+3=5; similarly, when we add 27 and 38 we will also use 2+3=5, despite the fact that the meaning of 2 and 3 in the second sum is completely different than in the first sum. In modern user interface terms, the numerals have the same affordances, despite their meaning being very different in the two cases."

**Notice**
We can't change the selection background in some menus yet, so make sure, that your colors will fit - avoid too light and too dark shades."
