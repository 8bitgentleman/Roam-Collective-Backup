        - **Activity:** Review, query, filter and browse the many [[questions]] captured so far in the graph. Begin to summarize them into fewer, well phrased questions. 
            - Questions that feel important, recurrent, or central or simply resonant should be turned into a [page-status questions]([[page-status questions]])

        - Processes:: Questions Workflow [*]([[page-status questions]])
            1. Document [[fleeting questions]] using `#Q`
            2. Review periodically, collecting ones that [resonate]([[resonance]]) or feel important to the direction of [[research]] and [[development]].
            3. Of the questions collected, promote some to page-status â€” making them easier to track, and creating a space for elaboration on the page contents.

        - "^^If one wants to build a castle from atoms, it helps to agree on what's a brick^^"
            - That's why lot of research processes start with taxonomies.
            - That's why we learn numbers and letters as children. We learn sentences, and for some people those bricks become speeches and books.

        - Following [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] ottered ðŸ¤£ðŸ¦¦ audio add considerations about
            - The way we digest is individual through exploration, but collective or at least shared through conversation. I'll add this comment on the RC-Roam when I find it
            - I have some thoughts on how what you said about narrative can be observed in successful storytelling.Â  I'll add later on the graph.
            - asynchronicity is good, but synchronicity -> standing waves -> increase in product -> successful relationship (which at times are referred as in sync)
(If you understand where I am going with this you can reference this bloc i will word it better and move it in my scratchpad preserving links. )

        - "What I'm VERY interested in, is finding ways to use an eventual [[datalog query builder]] identify pages as members of a collection based on the presences of `Tags::` + `[[Collection Name]]`"
            - I was thinking whether it would be possible to build tables like in notion, All my "bibliographical notes" have the same `Tags::` and it would be nice to see all of them as a table.

                - Epistemic status: intuition
                - Inspiration:
                    - Romans to algebraic numbers
                    - The Glass Bead Game
                - Zeitgeist: breaking the abstraction
    - #Questions ((about the graph, or directed towards someone)) #not_populated
    - #GTD
        - Finish thoughts on number analogy
        - Catch up on How To series
        - Go through Questions
    - #Conversation ((For nesting interactions with other members of the graph)) 
        - On organizing conversations  
            - On my mind as I logged in this morning: what did I miss? What were the important conversations about? #Q How can on get up to speed and ready to contribute in the least [costly]([[cost]]) way possible
                - As an axiom in the back of my mind:  it's better to expedite the "catch-up time" so people can spend more time contributing instead of just organizing what is going on
                    - [[@[[Charles Farr]]]] what you did was so incredibly helpful!  
                        - "In my [conversation](((fPou5O8sR))) section today I went through and titled every interaction I had â€” some explicit processing"
                    - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] How can I give Charles' convention a 1,000 upvotes? 
        - On the process of collaboration
            - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] [[maturity]], should consider the **acceptance of a term and claim among the community**, in the context of [[collaboration]]."
                - This is really striking at something
                - The challenge is - how does one define acceptance of a term? 
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[convergence]] is important to the creative process but is costly / has a [[transaction cost]]
                        - This is analogous to applying heat to molecules to create structure 
                        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] In a collaborative environment, [[cost]] of [[convergence]] scales with users
                            - It is costly to 
                                - (re: basis) have a (sufficient) basis of shared context
                                - (re: process) share mental models asynchronously 
                                - (re: outcome) align on implications
                            - #[[Q]] What are the right levels of abstraction for which [[convergence]] should be aspired to? 
        - On what gives abstraction power
            - "That's why we learn numbers and letters as children. We learn sentences, and for some people those bricks become speeches and books."
                - Exactly!  Have more thoughts on connections to numbers specifically, will return back later in the day
