            1. Document [[fleeting questions]] using `#Q`
            2. Review periodically, collecting ones that [resonate]([[resonance]]) or feel important to the direction of [[research]] and [[development]].
            3. Of the questions collected, promote some to page-status — making them easier to track, and creating a space for elaboration on the page contents.
