        - Processes:: Questions Workflow [*]([[page-status questions]])
            1. Document [[fleeting questions]] using `#Q`
            2. Review periodically, collecting ones that [resonate]([[resonance]]) or feel important to the direction of [[research]] and [[development]].
            3. Of the questions collected, promote some to page-status — making them easier to track, and creating a space for elaboration on the page contents.
        - #Ideas Nesting ideas under a block reference to the ["next steps" block](((KIIJBRnIY))) on the page. 
            - Example::
                - Thoughts on [[[[E:]] active vs passive resurfacing]]
                    - "Next Steps::"
                        - #[[Project Ideas]] develop a guide to thinking about resurfacing in Roam.
                        - Clarify methods of passive resurfacing
                        - Review how the [[Date Planner]] drives [[active resurfacing]]
            - [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] I'm thinking there should be an #I for Ideas (similar to Q for Questions)
                - This would actually allow us to remove `#Status/Idea` from the [maturity tags for conventions](((Knpb2iKrH))), see [here](((60WxP1deq))) ((could query for I + Conventions))
            - #I Perhaps a **Comments** attribute could be used to capture commentary on the note itself. [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] #Conventions
        - Considering changing #Promptstorming to #[[Daily Activities]]. To make that a place to nest responses to prompts AND contributions to daily activities.
            - Cons::
                - [[disambiguation]] with #[[Daily Log]]
                    - #Q What is the role of the Daily Log? Maybe it can be dropped... The** main feed /change log could handle it's contents.** Might be better actually to avoid the splitting of content.

            - Adoption of some [good queries](((jTQwEButc))) to place on my personal page.
        3. Added "Last Updated" and "Next Steps" as attributes to questions, evergreen notes, and creative projects templates. [*](((yURo5cs1L)))

                - #Q For "next steps", how could this be contributed to by multiple users?
        4. Added #I as a [block-level]([[block-level tags]]) ideas tag. (similar to "Q") #Conventions
        5. Nested the main DNP Section at the top. [*](((7hC24BFpU)))
    - #Promptstorming #not_populated

    - #[[The Zettelkasten]] 
        - #[[Project Ideas]] build a collection of [[activities]] that match with various stages of the [[[[E:]] double diamond model (design)]] as it relates to our [[zettelkasten]] and [[project management]] system.
    - #Conversation 
        1. On "1000 upvotes"
            - "[[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] How can I give Charles' convention a 1,000 upvotes? "
                - Ha! Agreed. This is a MUCH better visual experience. Well done, [[~[[Charles Farr]]]]
        2. On processing growing data in the graph.
            - "[[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] how are you approaching this: "#Q How do we digest all of the information we're adding to the graph?""
                - I've been thinking of my [[future self]] through the use of [[tagging]].
                    - 1) I use [this]([[[[E:]] Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]) idea as much as I can. 
                    - 2) I use the Bookmarks tag to flag things the ring particularly resonant.
                        - This helps as a filter on pages as well. 
                            - Image::
                                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2Fv76lWL9fSC.png?alt=media&token=648c2190-46e7-4dec-9ad4-a93d12d6e5fd)
                    - I believe processes here will evolve. 
                        - I consider most content quite fleeting and try to keep the good stuff by linking and tagging to concepts or collections I know will be more likely to [resurface]([[resurfacing]]).
                        - The idea of [[[[E:]] active vs passive resurfacing]] is related here. #Bookmarks
                            - Within [[passive resurfacing]], there are strategies we can hone to improve the [[probability]] of [[resurfacing]].
                                - E.g. use of [[zettelkasten]] notes to preserve main ideas.
                                - The questions I constantly ask myself (somewhat by second nature) is: 
                                    - "How do I want to come across this again?" 
                                    - "How important is it that I come across this again?"
                                    - "Is it time-sensitive?"
                                - "The questions I constantly ask myself (somewhat by second nature) is: "
                                    - [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] How would you tag these types of [[questions]]? They are more prompts, than questions, but related to a particular domain. Would you tag them as prompts?
                                        - Cons::
                                            - The linked references for `#Prompts` can serve as a place for people to suggest prompts to be added to the main library... adding more noise may decrease the value of the linked refs there?
                                                - Could this be combatted by use of a second tag?
                                                    - Like `#Prompts` + `#Status/Idea` in this [example](((5XvGIEuES)))?
        3. Accidentally discovered the meaning of the phrase "[[research]] & [[development]]" (R&D) [here](((wALPyzpN9))) haha.
            - Used that phrasing then realized: "Hey, that's R&D!" -- sign that "research" and "development" are great broad categories for tagging.
        4. On prompt-like questions:
            - "Are you asking specifically about how to tag these questions everytime you use them? Ultimately, the set of questions [here](((WiNFUPiec))) seems like a good [[algorithm of thought (AoT)]] to build using a template, in  which case I would just nest them under the tag for said AoT"
                - Love this solution. An AoT tag is the answer here. Great work. [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]]

        - "^^If one wants to build a castle from atoms, it helps to agree on what's a brick^^"
            - That's why lot of research processes start with taxonomies.
            - That's why we learn numbers and letters as children. We learn sentences, and for some people those bricks become speeches and books.

        - "What I'm VERY interested in, is finding ways to use an eventual [[datalog query builder]] identify pages as members of a collection based on the presences of `Tags::` + `[[Collection Name]]`"
            - I was thinking whether it would be possible to build tables like in notion, All my "bibliographical notes" have the same `Tags::` and it would be nice to see all of them as a table.
        - "Exactly!  Have more thoughts on connections to numbers specifically, will return back later in the day"
            - [[@[[Larissa de Lima]]]] I am so curious now.
        - Following [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] ottered 🤣🦦 audio add considerations about
            - The way we digest is individual through exploration, but collective or at least shared through conversation. 
                - Semantically speaking Conversation seems more open than comments and brings everyone on the same level.
            - The way we digest is individual through exploration, but collective or at least shared through conversation. I'll add this comment on the RC-Roam when I find it
            - I have some thoughts on how what you said about narrative can be observed in successful storytelling.  I'll add later on the graph.
            - When Brandon commented made about asynchronous editing/exploration, My contrarian mind immediately thought: "What happens when the editing and exploration are synchronous?!" 
                - I think that synchronous and aligned activities in a multiplayer zettelkasten can lead to compound effects like standing waves created by signals.
                - ![Standing wave - Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Waventerference.gif/310px-Waventerference.gif)
                - When everyone is in sinch, the compound effect of alignment and synchronicity can lead to a compound output of work. Increasing both quality and quantity. Conversely, when everyone is out of sync the continuos disagreement, contradiction or misalignment in purpose can produce no perceivable result.
                    - The danger in continuous alignment is that the output is unilaterally aligned in one direction missing the inquisitive intervention of the "contrarians". This can lead to confirmation bias, creation of echo chambers and in some extent cults and collectives 😂
                    - e.g. Good partners, when in synch are often referred to as power couples. __"You should see y best friend and I on a good day - we are unstoppable" - Peter__
                        - The synch does not necessarily need to be in amount of output: good friends and partners are often able to push each other even when only one of the two has energy. 
                - The up and down in the waveform below have some parallel with the [[[[E:]] double diamond model (design)]]. If you take the derivative of the waveform below (or if you imagine the speed of a ball going up and down), Zero speed is reached the highest points. I see this as the upper edges of the diamond. At this point, we have explored as much as our singular or collective brains can cope.  
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FnSb_C87Ivt.png?alt=media&token=09463f46-264a-4b4e-87b7-f57b8009a2e7)
                    - The dots on the bottom of the image also represent the density of air created by the air displacement carrying the sound. 
                        - If we imagine the molecules being output this new mental model matches the one I mentioned above as we narrow down we are allowed to move faster as we are carrying the momentum of the previous reflection period. This phase is characterized by a high-density output. 
                        - If we imagine our molecules being ideas, and we imagine to have to travel through the medium... the corner of the diamond are the moments in which we have to slow down because of the resistance we find in the high density of idea we find around ourselves.  When we start finding a narrower direction and purpose we are able to start moving faster and produce more ideas.

                - Is daily activities a top-level DNP block or one that could be nested within MDNs (My Daily Notes)?
                    - If under MDNs, would be great to programmatically inject prompts for  or activities for people to respond to — decreases the burden of needing to check to level
                    - Regardless, wonder if there is a way to build a pipeline of responses that get automatically injected into the top level — for instance, could pull in a random `#Q` block mention and ask the community to think on it...

    - #[[Change Log]]
        - Updated CSS for External Links (changed color, added trailing arrow, switched to `.rm-alias--external` selector)
            - "External Links #Status/Enabled"
        - Added color scheme setting
            - "Colors"
            - Note: Did not update any existing css code to utilize the `var()` best practice
                - {{[[TODO]]}} Standardize color scheme
                    - #Q Can Roam Collective develop a color scheme that better supports our key mission?
                        - This could be some standardization of colors for types of tags (e.g., shades of green for Meta tags)
        - Added SmartBlock to handle resurfacing: "#42SmartBlock .rc4AoT — Resurfacing for Future Me"
            - Not complete
            - Idea is this programs some level of spaced repetition for a user
                - Need to build some sort of aggregation query to find all overdue "resurfaced" blocks...
