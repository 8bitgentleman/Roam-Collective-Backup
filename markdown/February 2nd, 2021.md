            1. Document [[fleeting questions]] using `#Q`
            2. Review periodically, collecting ones that [resonate]([[resonance]]) or feel important to the direction of [[research]] and [[development]].
            3. Of the questions collected, promote some to page-status â€” making them easier to track, and creating a space for elaboration on the page contents.
    - #GTD #not_populated
    - #[[Change Log]] 
        1. Added the [[page-status questions]] conventions and process. #Status/Experimental
        2. Personally emulated some of the queries used by [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]]
            - Inclusion of initials in DNP Section heading to promote effective querying.
            - Adoption of some [good queries](((jTQwEButc))) to place on my personal page.

    - #Conversation 
        1. "[[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] How can I give Charles' convention a 1,000 upvotes? "
            - Ha! Agreed. This is a MUCH better visual experience. Well done, [[@[[Charles Farr]]]]
        2. On processing growing data in the graph.
            - "[[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] how are you approaching this: "#Q How do we digest all of the information we're adding to the graph?""
                - I've been thinking of my [[future self]] through the use of [[tagging]].
                    - 1) I use [this]([[[[E:]] Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]) idea as much as I can. 
                    - 2) I use the Bookmarks tag to flag things the ring particularly resonant.
                        - This helps as a filter on pages as well. 
                            - Image::
                                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2Fv76lWL9fSC.png?alt=media&token=648c2190-46e7-4dec-9ad4-a93d12d6e5fd)
                    - I believe processes here will evolve. 
                        - I consider most content quite fleeting and try to keep the good stuff by linking and tagging to concepts or collections I know will be more likely to [resurface]([[resurfacing]]).
                        - The idea of [[[[E:]] active vs passive resurfacing]] is related here. #Bookmarks
                            - Within [[passive resurfacing]], there are strategies we can hone to improve the [[probability]] of [[resurfacing]].
                                - E.g. use of [[zettelkasten]] notes to preserve main ideas.
                                - The questions I constantly ask myself (somewhat by second nature) is: 
                                    - "How do I want to come across this again?" 
                                    - "How important is it that I come across this again?"
                                    - "Is it time-sensitive?"
                                - "The questions I constantly ask myself (somewhat by second nature) is: "
                                    - [[@[[Charles Farr]]]] How would you tag these types of [[questions]]? They are more prompts, than questions, but related to a particular domain. Would you tag them as prompts?
                                        - Cons::
                                            - The linked references for `#Prompts` can serve as a place for people to suggest prompts to be added to the main library... adding more noise may decrease the value of the linked refs there?
                                                - Could this be combatted by use of a second tag?
                                                    - Like `#Prompts` + `#Status/Idea` in this [example](((5XvGIEuES)))?

        - "^^If one wants to build a castle from atoms, it helps to agree on what's a brick^^"
            - That's why lot of research processes start with taxonomies.
            - That's why we learn numbers and letters as children. We learn sentences, and for some people those bricks become speeches and books.
        - ((__GiaQWtl)
        - I am ill and the place I go is this graph to regurgitate thoughts. You broke me.

        - Answer to [[^[[Peter Rosso]]]]
            - {{[[query]]: {and: [[^[[Peter Rosso]]]] {not: [[query]]]}}}}
        - Following [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] ottered ðŸ¤£ðŸ¦¦ audio add considerations about
            - The way we digest is individual through exploration, but collective or at least shared through conversation. I'll add this comment on the RC-Roam when I find it
            - I have some thoughts on how what you said about narrative can be observed in successful storytelling.Â  I'll add later on the graph.
            - When Brandon commented made about asynchronous editing/exploration, My contrarian mind immediately thought: "What happens when the editing and exploration are synchronous?!" 
                - I think that synchronous and aligned activities in a multiplayer zettelkasten can lead to compound effects like standing waves created by signals.
                - ![Standing wave - Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Waventerference.gif/310px-Waventerference.gif)
                - When everyone is in sinch, the compound effect of alignment and synchronicity can lead to a compound output of work. Increasing both quality and quantity. Conversely, when everyone is out of sync the continuos disagreement, contradiction or misalignment in purpose can produce no perceivable result.
                    - The danger in continuous alignment is that the output is unilaterally aligned in one direction missing the inquisitive intervention of the "contrarians". This can lead to confirmation bias, creation of echo chambers and in some extent cults and collectives ðŸ˜‚
                    - e.g. Good partners, when in synch are often referred to as power couples. __"You should see y best friend and I on a good day - we are unstoppable" - Peter__
                        - The synch does not necessarily need to be in amount of output: good friends and partners are often able to push each other even when only one of the two has energy. 
                - ![Standing Waves](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/s6kOFb7oFLlNYBnH3ckq06GEo235Xn6IJ4-W4teQfhVmQ7cvp4zvU1ed6dkROOfiHuzns4lgwD96VwLX7k9tBct89tmW-prCiaiytp4tmAcz2E5eKuw8mbpEpXw)

            - I was thinking whether it would be possible to build tables like in notion, All my "bibliographical notes" have the same `Tags::` and it would be nice to see all of them as a table.

        - On the process of collaboration
            - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] [[maturity]], should consider the **acceptance of a term and claim among the community**, in the context of [[collaboration]]."
                - This is really striking at something
                - The challenge is - how does one define acceptance of a term? 
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[convergence]] is important to the creative process but is costly / has a [[transaction cost]]
                        - This is analogous to applying heat to molecules to create structure

                            - It is costly to 
                                - (re: basis) have a (sufficient) basis of shared context
