            1. Document [[fleeting questions]] using `#Q`
            2. Review periodically, collecting ones that [resonate]([[resonance]]) or feel important to the direction of [[research]] and [[development]].
            3. Of the questions collected, promote some to page-status — making them easier to track, and creating a space for elaboration on the page contents.
        - #Ideas Nesting ideas under a block reference to the ["next steps" block](((KIIJBRnIY))) on the page. 
            - Example::
                - Thoughts on [[[[E:]] active vs passive resurfacing]]
                    - "Next Steps::"
                        - #[[Project Ideas]] develop a guide to thinking about resurfacing in Roam.
                        - Clarify methods of passive resurfacing
                        - Review how the [[Date Planner]] drives [[active resurfacing]]
            - [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] I'm thinking there should be an #I for Ideas (similar to Q for Questions)

                    - #Q What is the role of the Daily Log? Maybe it can be dropped... The** main feed /change log could handle it's contents.** Might be better actually to avoid the splitting of content.

        5. Nested the main DNP Section at the top. [*](((7hC24BFpU)))
        6. Reverted CSS for external links to blue for now

                - Ha! Agreed. This is a MUCH better visual experience. Well done, [[~[[Charles Farr]]]]
        2. On processing growing data in the graph.
            - "[[^[[Brandon Toner]]]] how are you approaching this: "#Q How do we digest all of the information we're adding to the graph?""
                - I've been thinking of my [[future self]] through the use of [[tagging]].
                    - 1) I use [this]([[[[E:]] Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]) idea as much as I can. 
                    - 2) I use the Bookmarks tag to flag things the ring particularly resonant.
                        - This helps as a filter on pages as well. 
                            - Image::
                                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2Fv76lWL9fSC.png?alt=media&token=648c2190-46e7-4dec-9ad4-a93d12d6e5fd)
                    - I believe processes here will evolve. 
                        - I consider most content quite fleeting and try to keep the good stuff by linking and tagging to concepts or collections I know will be more likely to [resurface]([[resurfacing]]).
                        - The idea of [[[[E:]] active vs passive resurfacing]] is related here. #Bookmarks
                            - Within [[passive resurfacing]], there are strategies we can hone to improve the [[probability]] of [[resurfacing]].
                                - E.g. use of [[zettelkasten]] notes to preserve main ideas.
                                - The questions I constantly ask myself (somewhat by second nature) is: 
                                    - "How do I want to come across this again?" 
                                    - "How important is it that I come across this again?"
                                    - "Is it time-sensitive?"
                                - "The questions I constantly ask myself (somewhat by second nature) is: "
                                    - [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] How would you tag these types of [[questions]]? They are more prompts, than questions, but related to a particular domain. Would you tag them as prompts?
                                        - Cons::
                                            - The linked references for `#Prompts` can serve as a place for people to suggest prompts to be added to the main library... adding more noise may decrease the value of the linked refs there?
                                                - Could this be combatted by use of a second tag?
                                                    - Like `#Prompts` + `#Status/Idea` in this [example](((5XvGIEuES)))?
        3. Accidentally discovered the meaning of the phrase "[[research]] & [[development]]" (R&D) [here](((wALPyzpN9))) haha.
            - Used that phrasing then realized: "Hey, that's R&D!" -- sign that "research" and "development" are great broad categories for tagging.
        4. On prompt-like questions:
            - "Are you asking specifically about how to tag these questions everytime you use them? Ultimately, the set of questions [here](((WiNFUPiec))) seems like a good [[algorithm of thought (AoT)]] to build using a template, in  which case I would just nest them under the tag for said AoT"
                - Love this solution. An AoT tag is the answer here. Great work. [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]]
        5. On Roam Games - Dhrumil
            - "going to spend some time tonight on [[Roam Games]], anyone doing it this week? we can jam together."
                - Nice! Welcome to the graph [[~[[Dhrumil Shah]]]]!
                - I know there's a Clubhouse call tonight at 10PM ET where some folks will likely be talking Roam Games.
                - Best bet is to start riffing in your Scratchpad section, and whoever is around will likely comment /chime in. I'll be off & on throughout the night. 
        6. On external CSS
            - "I don't disagree — happy to tweak it — though all of Andy's posts have a lot of external links"
                - I find the blue a bit easier on the eyes, and the underline helps to identify as an external link. [[cc:[[Peter Rosso]]]], [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]]
                    - Opted for version 1
                        - PS LOVE the versioning in CSS. 
        7. Charles on color conventions
            - "Added color scheme setting"
                - Love this idea. Yea I think a color strategy would be fun. [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]]
        8. #Replies
            - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] I like to top level summary for most sections where significant works goes on underneath a single block"
                - Agreed. Been doing that a bit, but will do more often.
            - "Regardless, wonder if there is a way to build a pipeline of responses that get automatically injected into the top level — for instance, could pull in a random `#Q` block mention and ask the community to think on it..."
                - This type of [[randomization]] will be VERY good once we distill the Qs a bit (need to randomize from a smaller, higher quality set of options, IMO) [[@[[Charles Farr]]]]

            - I was thinking whether it would be possible to build tables like in notion, All my "bibliographical notes" have the same `Tags::` and it would be nice to see all of them as a table.
        - "Exactly!  Have more thoughts on connections to numbers specifically, will return back later in the day"
            - [[@[[Larissa de Lima]]]] I am so curious now.
        - Following [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] ottered 🤣🦦 audio add considerations about
            - The way we digest is individual through exploration, but collective or at least shared through conversation. 
                - Semantically speaking Conversation seems more open than comments and brings everyone on the same level.
            - The way we digest is individual through exploration, but collective or at least shared through conversation. I'll add this comment on the RC-Roam when I find it
            - I have some thoughts on how what you said about narrative can be observed in successful storytelling.  I'll add later on the graph.
            - When Brandon commented made about [[asynchronous]] editing/exploration, My contrarian mind immediately thought: "What happens when the editing and exploration are [[synchronous]]?!" 
                - I think that synchronous and aligned activities in a multiplayer[[ zettelkasten]] can lead to compound effects like [[standing waves]] created by signals.
                    - GIF::
                        - ![Standing wave - Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Waventerference.gif/310px-Waventerference.gif)
                - When everyone is in sinch, the compound effect of [[alignment]] and [[synchronicity]] can lead to a compound output of work. Increasing both quality and quantity. Conversely, when everyone is out of sync the continuos disagreement, contradiction or misalignment in purpose can produce no perceivable result.
                    - The danger in continuous alignment is that the output is unilaterally aligned in one direction missing the inquisitive intervention of the "[[contrarians]]". This can lead to [[confirmation bias]], creation of echo chambers and in some extent cults and collectives 😂
                    - e.g. Good partners, when in synch are often referred to as power couples. __"You should see y best friend and I on a good day - we are unstoppable" - Peter__
                        - The synch does not necessarily need to be in amount of output: good friends and partners are often able to push each other even when only one of the two has energy. 
                - The up and down in the waveform below have some parallel with the [[[[E:]] double diamond model (design)]]. If you take the derivative of the waveform below (or if you imagine the speed of a ball going up and down), Zero speed is reached the highest points. I see this as the upper edges of the diamond. At this point, we have explored as much as our singular or collective brains can cope.  
                    - Image::
                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FnSb_C87Ivt.png?alt=media&token=09463f46-264a-4b4e-87b7-f57b8009a2e7)
                    - The dots on the bottom of the image also represent the density of air created by the air displacement carrying the sound. 
                        - If we imagine the molecules being output this new mental model matches the one I mentioned above as we narrow down we are allowed to move faster as we are carrying the momentum of the previous reflection period. This phase is characterized by a high-density output. 
                        - If we imagine our molecules being ideas, and we imagine to have to travel through the medium... the corner of the diamond are the moments in which we have to slow down because of the resistance we find in the high density of idea we find around ourselves.  When we start finding a narrower direction and purpose we are able to start moving faster and produce more ideas.

            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Creating a symbolic language or user interface that allows ease in "performing operations" on atomic claims would be analogous to inventing hindu-arabic numberals
                - Epistemic status: I know this is a bold claim!! 😜 it's a strongly held intuition - but one that seems almost axiomatically true to me?  Also feels very "zeitgeist"-y?  Would love to discuss if someone believes in the counter.  
                    - As a sidenote, this belief is actually the reason I became excited with Roam in the first place, and exploring what "performing operations" on thought/language could mean is part of my personal motivation in joining the Roam Collective, so might as well come clean about it  
                - Arguments:
                    - Part of what made hindu-arabic numerals so powerful, especially relative to Roman numerals, was how easy it made basic mathematical operations (e.g., addition, multiplication, subtraction).  The history of math is full of examples of symbolic language then leading to conceptual breakthroughs

                    - [This piece](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) by [[Andy Matuschak]] and [[Michael Nielson]] is a manifesto to seed building of "tools of thought".  It's generally worth a read; it invites related yet different conclusions as it asks: How to invent Hindu-Arabic numerals?
                        - While the fleeting note above is related to asking: "How to invent Hindu-Arabic numerals for thought," what the article explores instead is an arguably broader question: How to foster tools that allow productive answers to "How to invent Hindu-Arabic numerals for X" (where X can be any domain of knowledge) 
                        - Their explanation of what makes Hindu-Arabic numerals amazing is good
                            - >  ...it’s worth pointing out that the Hindu-Arabic numerals aren’t just an extraordinary piece of design. They’re also an extraordinary mathematical insight. They involve many non-obvious ideas, if all you know is Roman numerals. Perhaps most remarkably, the meaning of a numeral actually __changes__, depending on its position within a number. Also remarkable, consider that when we add the numbers 72 and 83 we at some point will likely use 2+3=5; similarly, when we add 27 and 38 we will also use 2+3=5, despite the fact that the meaning of 2 and 3 in the second sum is completely different than in the first sum. In modern user interface terms, the numerals have the same affordances, despite their meaning being very different in the two cases.

                - This is really striking at something

                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[convergence]] is important to the creative process but is costly / has a [[transaction cost]]
                        - This is analogous to applying heat to molecules to create structure

        - Background on the [[zettelkasten]]
            - #Evergreen What is a Zettelkasten?
                - At its core, a zettelkasten is a store of knowledge. Over time, it accumulates new bits and connections, reflecting the learnings of the individual (or community).
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] A [[zettelkasten]] is both an artifact and a process; that nature of knowledge is such that the process of building one never really ceases
                - Translating the German word "Zettelkasten" means Slipbox. Its originator, [[Nicolas Luhmann]], was a sociology professor who built a slipbox over decades, enabling him to publish prodigiously. 
                    - [[Nicolas Luhmann]]'s captured insights in his zettelkasten as [[permanent notes]], working on pieces of paper.
                        - His approach was to capture the entirety of a note at one time and then filing it away within his physical slipbox for later rediscovery and use.
                        - While Luhmann is a great inspiration for the newfound applications of zettelkasten for knowledge management, it seems advisable to update the approach for our modern times and differing objectives. Luhmann was focused on academic research and publish (publications that most of us would consider to be quite "dense").

                - As far as tagging questions like these, I've just been adding the `#Q` tag — ultimately for most of the questions I've identified, I would like to return to them
                - Are you asking specifically about how to tag these questions everytime you use them? Ultimately, the set of questions [here](((WiNFUPiec))) seems like a good [[algorithm of thought (AoT)]] to build using a template, in  which case I would just nest them under the tag for said AoT

            - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] re: "Considering [this change](((j_FNzzIhb))), thoughts? [[~[[Charles Farr]]]]"
                - Is daily activities a top-level DNP block or one that could be nested within MDNs (My Daily Notes)?
                    - If under MDNs, would be great to programmatically inject prompts for  or activities for people to respond to — decreases the burden of needing to check to level
                    - Regardless, wonder if there is a way to build a pipeline of responses that get automatically injected into the top level — for instance, could pull in a random `#Q` block mention and ask the community to think on it...
