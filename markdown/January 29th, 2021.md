    1. I decided to consider [this idea]([[active vs passive resurfacing]]) an evergreen note. I think it makes sense, but it challenges my idea that "#[[Fleeting Notes]] [[fleeting notes]] and [[evergreen notes]] should be [[assertions]]. #zettelkasten"

            - When referencing a prompt into the DNP, it adds a reference to the prompt.
                - I would prefer if presenting the prompts on the DNP didn't add to the block reference count. This is especially misleading when the same prompt is included in the Daily Writing Prompts for several days. ([[false-positive]] for user-responses.)

            - How could users "**suggest edits**" to a page?
                - E.g. Add references to an evergreen note.
                - Ideas::
                    - Block reference the block where the edit would be added, nest the ideas, then add a tag to the block that would capture the editors' attention. (i.e. tag them + `[[[[Feedback]]: [[Suggestions]]]]`)
                    - Another option is to give all users permission to edit/add to all pages.
            - What should the [top section](((skozg-bg0))) be called officially? 
                - Related:: [[DNP Section]]
        - Just remembered a [[Roam Book Club]] convention that I liked ‚Äî¬†[the central chat.](((ZlhKC6b2i))) 
            - So I added a Chat tag to the top section.

            - I'm not sure I agree with this, but I sort of do.

        - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] what do you think about: "Looking at all of the [[SmartBlocks]] in the graph and I think we need to have an approach for delineating between personal SmartBlocks (and templates) and community ones #Conventions""
            - Yup, really like this idea. cc: [[@[[Charles Farr]]]]
                - For personal naming conventions, I like `BToner` ([FLast])((reason: keeps the initials intact, so I can type BT)) or a personally designated SmartBlock user code. It doesn't really matter what it is as long as it is: #Conventions
                    - Easy to trigger.
                    - Unique (no conflict with another user (i.e. 2 "BT's" in the graph))
                    - Doesn't get confused with the global smartblock ("Community functions" [*](((DcXN7XPbc)))).
                        - I like the (CR) convention here. __Though that kinda feels like a name initial__ (i.e. BT)... but I think it's fine.
                        - Love [this](((pNHeT0VNp))) convention... I'm gonna adopt.
I'd also add a `.` before the `rcDNP` to `.rcDNP` to benefit in [[sorting]].

        - "The UI/UX for such things will get complicated quickly. So having a variety of global navigation blocks or similar might be useful here [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]. You could also see an example, though not really for this exactly, here [‚û°Ô∏è](((lRBaD3yYL)))"
            - Yea, agreed. As far as "following" goes, I'd like to keep it simple for now, and encourage others to envision how this might look logistically. 
            - My approach might be to collect some favourite topic tags, add them in relevant spots, and to rely on [[passive]] or "[[just-in-time]]" [[resurfacing]] 
        - #how-should-I-tag-this #Tensions
            - [[active vs passive resurfacing]]
                - Is this an [evergreen note]([[evergreen notes]])? Maybe. It's more a chapter title.
                    - Less of an [assertion]([[assertions]]), but it is a concept that I refer to periodically. 
                    - **I'm going to call it an EN**... because it's UTILITY feels similar/the same. 
        - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] I would like to add the [query builder script](https://roamjs.com/docs/extensions/query-builder) to the graph"
            - Fire away! [[@[[Matthew Vogel]]]] üöÄ, just document in the Change Log within your section (added one for you)
        - "Ok. Will this be the standard convention to NOT include inline references, but instead comment as a child to the reference?? One of the big reasons I ask is that it would then be required to open the context breadcrumbs to actually see the message that is being brought to your attention. Honestly not that big of a deal frankly. Just an observation [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]]"

        - The UI design [example](((lRBaD3yYL))) from [[Mark Robertson]] really show us the limitless possibility that what [[Roam]] UI can achieve. In other words, we might set our mind free first before we‚Äôre trying to implement the UI system in [[Roam]].
        - Maybe we could [[model]] our [[Roam]] [[collaboration]] system with game design mindset, like a RPG game?
            - **Global public feed** that‚Äôs official way that help showing new comer what‚Äôs current trend(daily/weekly/monthly) in community.
                - It‚Äôs kind of like an official newsletter.
                - maybe it becomes a work for a recommendation system, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs good or not.
            - **Roaman media feed** that‚Äôs hold by an individual/a group of Roaman.
                - It‚Äôs the free choice for a Roaman to subscribe this feed.
            - Private communication
            - Official event
        - [Global public feed](((_TioVNn4W))) and [Roaman media feed](((FGNR8b-M7))) should obey [Roam publish protocol](((Mfh93O_VB))), i.e. with a `#publish` tag or some more meta-data.
        - **‚ÄúPublic vs Private‚Äù** is one **dimension** to address the **‚Äòspace‚Äô** concept.
