            - When referencing a prompt into the DNP, it adds a reference to the prompt.
                - I would prefer if presenting the prompts on the DNP didn't add to the block reference count. This is especially misleading when the same prompt is included in the Daily Writing Prompts for several days. ([[false-positive]] for user-responses.)

        - Thanks for [your reply](((n_PNVqwuw))). I need to clarify my [custom css idea](((FehE8jv6_))) more here, my idea is that maybe everyone will have their own ‘best’ css setting, though some basic [[alignment]] would accelerate our [[communication]] efficiency. But the **actual point** I want to make is probably trying to distinguish the idea of **‘private’ and ‘public’** when doing [[collaboration]]. [[@[[Charles Farr]]]]
