            - Here, I’m introducing the idea that the [[collaborative zettelkasten]] is the key to carrying mature ideas forward through time.

This addresses the problem of “missing things”. If ideas are documented in zettelkasten conventions, then they are easier to rediscover through various [[resurfacing]] methods.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] When ideas are documented in [[zettelkasten]] [[conventions]], they persist through time. This improves [[resurfacing]].

                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] personal authorship of [[evergreen notes]] is overrated.
                    - As long as authorship is **documented**, an effective zettelkasten should consider ideas from a variety of authors. 
                        - In addition, in a [[collaborative zettelkasten]] there are notes from numerous authors ANYWAY. So inclusion of notes from authors external to the graph should be fair game.

                    - What is the dividing line between an [evergreen note]([[evergreen notes]]) and an [article]([[articles]])?
                        - I consider this as I add some of [[Andy Matuschak]]'s notes to the EN library in the graph. I consider these ENs rather than articles. 
                        - My justification is that Andy's notes are [[atomic]]. If they were complex notes, containing multiple ideas, I would consider them articles, and use the reference notes template to interact with their contents.
        - #[[Wish List]] #Ideas
            - I would love to be able to have complex queries for:
                - ENs written by members of the graph ((i.e. exclude external authors like Andy M))
                    - ENs NOT written by members of the graph
            - #Comments
                - "members of the graph" [*](((dYIpKh0sF)))

            - When referencing a prompt into the DNP, it adds a reference to the prompt.

                - For personal naming conventions, I like `BToner` ([FLast])((reason: keeps the initials intact, so I can type BT)) or a personally designated SmartBlock user code. It doesn't really matter what it is as long as it is: #Conventions

            - Yea, I think we'll go with nesting as standard convention for now. My strategy for navigating is to Shift-click to open the reference in the side bar, giving me easier access to the [[breadcrumbs]]. [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]]
