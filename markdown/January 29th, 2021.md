            - When referencing a prompt into the DNP, it adds a reference to the prompt.
                - I would prefer if presenting the prompts on the DNP didn't add to the block reference count. This is especially misleading when the same prompt is included in the Daily Writing Prompts for several days. ([[false-positive]] for user-responses.)

            - How could users "**suggest edits**" to a page?
                - E.g. Add references to an evergreen note.
                - Ideas::
                    - Block reference the block where the edit would be added, nest the ideas, then add a tag to the block that would capture the editors' attention. (i.e. tag them + `[[[[Feedback]]: [[Suggestions]]]]`)
                    - Another option is to give all users permission to edit/add to all pages.
            - What should the [top section](((skozg-bg0))) be called officially?

        - "[[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] what do you think about: "Looking at all of the [[SmartBlocks]] in the graph and I think we need to have an approach for delineating between personal SmartBlocks (and templates) and community ones #Conventions""
            - Yup, really like this idea. cc: [[@[[Charles Farr]]]]
                - For personal naming conventions, I like `BToner` ([FLast])((reason: keeps the initials intact, so I can type BT)) or a personally designated SmartBlock user code. It doesn't really matter what it is as long as it is: #Conventions
                    - Easy to trigger.
                    - Unique (no conflict with another user (i.e. 2 "BT's" in the graph))
                    - Doesn't get confused with the global smartblock ("Community functions" [*](((DcXN7XPbc)))).
                        - I like the (CR) convention here. __Though that kinda feels like a name initial__ (i.e. BT)... but I think it's fine.
                        - Love [this](((pNHeT0VNp))) convention... I'm gonna adopt.
I'd also add a `.` before the `rcDNP` to `.rcDNP` to benefit in [[sorting]].

            - Yea, agreed. As far as "following" goes, I'd like to keep it simple for now, and encourage others to envision how this might look logistically. 
            - My approach might be to collect some favourite topic tags, add them in relevant spots, and to rely on [[passive]] or "[[just-in-time]]" [[resurfacing]]

            - [[active vs passive resurfacing]]
                - Is this an [evergreen note]([[evergreen notes]])? Maybe. It's more a chapter title.
                    - Less of an [assertion]([[assertions]]), but it is a concept that I refer to periodically. 
                    - **I'm going to call it an EN**... because it's UTILITY feels similar/the same.

        - "Ok. Will this be the standard convention to NOT include inline references, but instead comment as a child to the reference?? One of the big reasons I ask is that it would then be required to open the context breadcrumbs to actually see the message that is being brought to your attention. Honestly not that big of a deal frankly. Just an observation [[^[[Brandon Toner]]]]"
            - Yea, I think we'll go with nesting as standard convention for now. My strategy for navigating is to Shift-click to open the reference in the side bar, giving me easier access to the [[breadcrumbs]]. [[~[[Mark Robertson]]]] 
                - Definitely open to re-evaluating this over time.

            - Yup, I plan to continue to leave lots of documentation/justification, thinking out loud.
            - Loving your commentary of the conventions, this type of dialogue is the path forward.

        - The UI design [example](((lRBaD3yYL))) from [[Mark Robertson]] really show us the limitless possibility that what [[Roam]] UI can achieve. In other words, we might set our mind free first before we‚Äôre trying to implement the UI system in [[Roam]].
        - Maybe we could [[model]] our [[Roam]] [[collaboration]] system with game design mindset, like a RPG game?
            - **Global public feed** that‚Äôs official way that help showing new comer what‚Äôs current trend(daily/weekly/monthly) in community.
                - It can be [[model]]ed as official newsletter.
                - It can be [[model]]ed as real time notification to Roamans.
                - maybe it becomes a work for a recommendation system, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs good or not.
            - **Roaman media feed** that‚Äôs hold by an individual/a group of Roaman.
                - It‚Äôs the free choice for a Roaman decide whether or not subscribing this feed, and the content on the feed is determined by the Roaman/group of Roaman.
            - **Private communication**, should be easy to create and easy to delete.
                - Maybe it‚Äôs not necessarily to delete private messages actually, we could **just make it hard to find**, or hides behind the auto-complete list, but that maybe a job for [[Roam]] team. For us, in order to create such a space, we may insert some encoded content into [[Roam]] block which is hard to become a auto-complete candidates and then decoded it via the chatting plugin.
            - **Official event** maybe included topics that we(the whole community) want to focus on, which may need a good voting mechanism.
        - [Global public feed](((_TioVNn4W))) and [Roaman media feed](((FGNR8b-M7))) should obey [Roam publish protocol](((Mfh93O_VB))), i.e. with a `#publish` tag or some more meta-data.

        - One reward for Roaman with high reputation in "Roam reputation system" may be the permission to create new page? If we view [[Roam]] page as a kind of resource.
        - Maybe, we could view page as [[truth]], in one [[Roam]] database, one [[Roam]] community, where these [[truth]] are built on axioms and logical inference, and [[communication]] mechanism is a basic foundation to support the emergence of logical inferences.
        - [Viewing page as truth](((H6M1XTGet))) is a concrete [[goals]] to make our [[communication]] [[converge]].

            - You may want to distinguish these two concepts a little bit deep first. And the distinctions themselves will become [[assertions]].
                - **Effec**t: By breaking them into smaller distinctions, we may get a more clear sense on how you define these terms.

            - Another item to consider is that long discussions (with this convention) will indent very quickly, potentially leaving little to no room for readability as we move closer to the right margin.
