            - I found an interesting consideration about what you said in a Sci-Fi book I was reading last weekend.
        - Can we map out all of the topics we have discussed over last week in a page and as important notes correction were made things can be ~~struck through~~ or they can converge to a permanent note.
            - I find conversation difficult to follow at times, how so we bring them to a one page view?
        - are there #conventions about how to react to people entries? If I just wanted to upvote a message, validate it or show that I read an `[[everyone]]` message we could just react to the block like I am reacting to this message. 
        - Conventions for Î”?

        - [[Everyone]] do we have weekly and monthly reviews which can be used as structured ways to force convergence? Structured reviews become like habits and take increasingly less time and become frictionless as the systems put in place make them easy to perform [[cc:[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[cc:[[Larissa de Lima]]]] [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] ((Shall we have review cycles to force convergence of certain topics so that we don't diverge too much?))
            - e.g. Weekly reviews: https://youtu.be/kNL6mA5kRec
            - "Think it could be interesting to explore - what types of questions / template are you envisioning?"
                - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] we need to make a decision on what information to keep coming back which to archive and possibly which to delete. Or at least we need to have a conversation about what are our objectives. For examples my management system is still in notion, for now, my weekly pages give me an overview of the important things I wrote/noted in daily pages (e.g. did I stick to my habits, how did I sleep, how happy was I?) Having all of that information in one place you can go through them and decide what is to be forgotten and only found when searched, what needs to be archived, or what needs to be dealt with and when. That works well with tasks, but how do we do something similar?
At the end of a week/month, I feel like fleeting notes should be reorganised in a page forming a conversation which might lead the following week to some permanent notes. [[cc[[Larissa de Lima]]]] [[cc[[Charles Farr]]]] 
__I love that your comment came from back in time ðŸ¤£!!__

Monthly reviews could include a zoom catchup?
"How could synchronous tools like [[Zoom]] or [[Clubhouse]] be used to support collaboration in a collaborative graph?"
        - [[Everyone]] How do we develop a skill to have divergent and convergent conversations. I think lots of interesting conversation with friends just kept on diverging until nobody remembered why we were discussing what and we just moved on. Not all conversations need to go somewhere, but is there a skill?

        - Our [[communication]] mechanism right now, using `@/cc`, is emulating mail system, which is implicitly [[asynchronous]].
        - I personally love mailing, which is a good balance between slow and fast thinking, especially when Iâ€™m having question to solve.
        - in-time chat vs mail-based chat is one typical implementation on [sync vs async](((0eWl7ORS7))) [[communication]].
        - Actually, is [sync vs async](((0eWl7ORS7))) actually a subjective definition?
        - Our current [[communication]] [[conventions]] feels like a mix of in-time chat and mail-based chat.
        - If I consider face-to-face chatting is truly [[synchronous]], compared with other [[communication]] method, then I could think of some differences as shown below ... 
            - enables [[divergence]] easily.
                - Assumption: everyoneâ€™s mind is reasonable.
                - Under [this assumption](((5SJKfkOSd))), in the situation that our communication topic jump from one to another, there must a way to reason about such transformation.
                    - the input for the transformation is mostly(?) related to states, which can be outside-world state(e.g. touch, voice, etc.) and/or inner-world state(oneâ€™s own thinking)
                    - #[[P:Self]] normally, when weâ€™re in the context of [[communication]], the content of communication itself has high priority in our thought, but when the content isnâ€™t interesting me, its priority decreases and my own thoughts(not much related to current topic, even not related to the whole conversation) floats up and I may suddenly change the topic. And sometimes, other will feels weird.
                    - #[[P:Self]] Sometimes, something clicked in my mind, but itâ€™s off context of the whole communication, and I canâ€™t help saying that thoughts out and other will also feel weird.
                - When weâ€™re talking face-to-face, we share much more states than pure words communication. AND, every shared state is the potential link to another topic, meaning that we have much more broader choices on topics, and therefore, much more possible for a [[divergent]] [[communication]].
                - #[[P:Self]] Sadly speaking, this may be the core reason why I donâ€™t like casual phone call, seems that i donâ€™t have much â€˜hooksâ€™ to do fast association with pure voice when the content itself has not much structure(even with my previous girl friend...). Kind of weird, man...

        - [[@[[Zsolt VicziÃ¡n]]]] has put together several smartblock templates that will run a datalog query and display it in a nice way. It's great work and an exceptionally good article but in my opinion actually pollutes the graph with `:hiccup` blocks. The better way would probably be to use [[roam/render]] custom components
            - You can get his smartblocks [here](https://zsviczian.github.io/DatomicQuery.zip) but be warned they're very complicated.  Nothing like the simple system you've imagined.
        - {{[[embed]]: ((((0nxSPSAyD))))}}
    - #Questions ((about the graph, or directed towards someone)) 
        - How do you #query? for blocks that contain 2 tags and not for when one is a child of the other
            - i.e. look for this 
                - #tag1 #tag2
            - Not this
                - #tag1
                    - #tag2
    - #Conversation 
        - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] Short answer, no. Namespaces aren't expressed in CSS, they're interpreted by Roam's internal parser. The only way I know of changing the namespace is through user prefs.[*](((uAKl3yKFe)))
            - I uses namespaces extensively in my personal graph since I know they'll be useful in the future but at this moment in Roam they're cosmetic. You can't query for them without #datalog . Right now it feels like page references in the page name work alright but I often end up duplicating the page reference under a [[Tags]] attribute so who knows lol 
        - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] what benefit do you see for filtering a page using [[OR]] instead of constructing a regular #query ? 
`{{[[query]]: {or: [[ex-B]] [[ex-C]]}}}`
