        - #Tips 
            - For [[SmartBlocks]] that **do not contain any commands**, launch using the native Roam template engine for faster performance `;;`
            - Use `CTRL+Hover` to preview a page or a block reference using [[Roam42]] [[Live Preview]]
                - This is helpful when using something like the [random fleeting notes](((9j2PVNMXj))) SmartBlock to be able to quickly view for who authored the note (it'll show in the [[breadcrumbs]]).
        - #[[Writing & Reflection]]
            - __Reminder: Please delete any block references where you did not add any annotations to prevent "empty references"__

    - #[[Scratchpad]]
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] block-level [[model]]
            - **Definition**: (Logical) structure that could be contained within a single block ((one way to understand this is, using one sentence to conclude what you wanna express)).
            - **Significance**: Based on this semantic, we could design block based CSS, which could convey structure in a visual way. 
            - Example:: Actually, we could think of current `#Fleeting Notes` and `#Evergreen` a kind of "#[[Fleeting Notes]] block-level [[model]]".
            - Example:: Try to think of the following situation, saying that I want to **distinguish two concepts by introducing their difference**. 
""#[[Fleeting Notes]] block-embed [[model]]" conveys information in a rather ‘networked way’ while "#[[Fleeting Notes]] block-level [[model]]" conveys information in a ‘linear way’. #[[.concept/difference]]"
                - [[Related]] to [view concepts with different lenses](((MawQmWVvk)))
                - [[Related]] to [substructure graph generation](((WC25L-wqT)))
            - **Origin**: This is a concept I come up when I try to generalize the AXYZ [[model]] ((A do X under Y condition and observe Z)) purposed by [[Joel Chan]], based on my own understanding.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] block-embed [[model]]
            - Example:: {{[[embed]]: ((zFyFH7Z_m))}}
        - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] block-embed [[model]]" conveys information in a rather ‘networked way’ while "#[[Fleeting Notes]] block-level [[model]]" conveys information in a ‘linear way’. #[[.concept/difference]]
        - [This example](((__BAONQ4o))) serves as my supportive argument on [adding a tag which could hide content of css](((LKFDKdVqQ))). Otherwise, if we refer to more than two blocks at the same time, it’s somehow visually annoying.
    - #[[Chat]]
        - Some concepts stay in mind for a long time and would like to discuss with you guys.
        - Don’t know if these are [[fruitful]] new concepts for you. "#[[Fleeting Notes]] block-level [[model]]" and "#[[Fleeting Notes]] block-embed [[model]]" [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]]
