        - #Tips 
            - For [[SmartBlocks]] that **do not contain any commands**, launch using the native Roam template engine for faster performance `;;`
            - Use `CTRL+Hover` to preview a page or a block reference using [[Roam42]] [[Live Preview]]
                - This is helpful when using something like the [random fleeting notes](((9j2PVNMXj))) SmartBlock to be able to quickly view for who authored the note (it'll show in the [[breadcrumbs]]).
        - #[[Writing & Reflection]]
            - __Reminder: Please delete any block references where you did not add any annotations to prevent "empty references"__
