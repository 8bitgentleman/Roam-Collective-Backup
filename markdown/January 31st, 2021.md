        - #Tips 
            - For [[SmartBlocks]] that **do not contain any commands**, launch using the native Roam template engine for faster performance `;;`
            - Use `CTRL+Hover` to preview a page or a block reference using [[Roam42]] [[Live Preview]]
                - This is helpful when using something like the [random fleeting notes](((9j2PVNMXj))) SmartBlock to be able to quickly view for who authored the note (it'll show in the [[breadcrumbs]]).
        - #Observations
            - A new DNP can begin as quite empty. A new visitor to the graph may not think to "go back a day" to see most recent content. 
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] the blank [[DNP]] and [this effect](((92Z_Zq-zn))) provides incentive to write each day to keep the graph momentum going.
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Keeping up the [[momentum]] is important in a [[collaborative graph]] to keep it interesting and worthwhile for participants.

            - There is too much overlap right now.
            - Do I use Q, Questions, Open Questions, Context Questions, Zettel Questions?
            - Thoughts:
                - Need something parallel to fleeting, literature, evergreen.
                    - fleeting: 
                        - fully formed questions, designed to be able elicit reflection or discussion. It should be context independent and fully formed.
                        - Suggestion:: `#[[Open Questions]]`
                    - literature:
                        - maybe these could be questions that help to map the outline of a resource â€” mapping the questions the author is seeking to answer with their writing.
                        - Outline Questions sorta.
                        - Suggestion:: `#[[Context Questions]]` â†’ Don't __love__ this name yet
                    - evergreen
                        - important questions
                        - Well formed and context independent.
                        - These serve as North Stars, helping to orient towards a [clear aim]([[E/Have a clear aim]]) or purpose.
                        - These research questions guide the work. They frame the search and help to focus efforts and facilitate alignment.
                        - They should be elevated to [[page status]], and should be frequently referenced in related discussions.
                            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[evergreen notes]] and [[zettel questions]] should be very familiar to group members to facilitate their frequent tagging in related [[resources]], [[ideas]] and [[discussions]].
                                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Not ALL evergreen notes and zettel questions should be on the [[mental fingertips]] of group members â€” just the ones that are related to central to active pursuits.

        1. #[[Graph Mentorship]]
            - While making [[fleeting notes]], try to make them into full descriptive sentences so that they make more sense in isolation from their original context. I generally use the guidance of [[E/Evergreen note titles are like APIs]] to apply to fleeting notes. 
The difference is that FNs are a bit more "rough" or less timeless in their content. They may be redundant with other notes, or require some further thinking. That's ok, that's the purpose of the note class.
                - Example:: 
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoam-Collective%2FIkjY3wRCo4.png?alt=media&token=e844dd85-e65d-4ea4-b690-f469694e1a41)
                    - Note that each FN conveys a complete idea. 
        2. #Replies
            - "[This example](((__BAONQ4o))) serves as my supportive argument on [adding a tag which could hide content of css](((LKFDKdVqQ))). Otherwise, if we refer to more than two blocks at the same time, itâ€™s somehow visually annoying."
                - I solve this appearance issue by using [[aliases]]. Does this help? [[@[[leekeifon]]]]
                - The reason I'm hesitant to change the css related to [[fleeting notes]] is that the tag is a helpful [visual cue]([[visual cues]]) to trigger the the presence of a zettelkasten idea in various contexts.
            - "Donâ€™t know if these are [[fruitful]] new concepts for you. "#[[Fleeting Notes]] block-level [[model]]" and "#[[Fleeting Notes]] block-embed [[model]]" [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]]"
                - I haven't fully [grokked]([[grok]]) the idea yet â€”Â but I think I definitely use a combination of [references]([[block references]]) and [embeds]([[block embeds]]) when making references. 
                    - Factors I use to choose:
                        - Do I want to also display children blocks?
                        - Do I want easy access to editing the content from the reference destination?
            - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] Learning [[collaboration]] requires separate clear shared [[goals]], to enable the process of learning collaboration to serve as a meta-goal"
                - Excellent documentation on this!! 
                    - Maybe consider [appending some relevant tags](((wyoVYXVX9))) to the line as well to promote [[resurfacing]].
                        - Id suggest:
                            - collaboration
                            - goals

            - "ADDRESSED - Are smartblocks working?  Wasn't able to action it for my daily page"
                - I think every person needs to activate the [[roam/js]] block. I'll add that to getting started along with a link to [[About [[Roam-Collective]]]]. Thanks! 
            - "Given how unbounded Roam can be, could it be helpful to present the quick steps as a video?"
                - Yup, this would be cool. My video-creating skills are less than fine-tuned so I'll need to figure out how that best looks workflow-wise. 
                - I can record GIFs pretty easily, so I might start tossing them into the mix more often. 
            - "Is there value in adding something like "epistemic status" to fleeting notes - so people know immediately if it's just some spitballing or something more robust?"
                - I saw this and love the idea! I've used `Rationale::` with similar purpose on occasion... maybe `Basis::`? I see it as an [[E/optional, but beneficial]] step. 
            - "Logged bio and DNT around 9:30AM EST, logging off at 10:45AM EST. LOL jk, logging off at 10:56AM EST"
                - I'd place this within a Daily Log module instead. 
                - Change Log is best for changes to the graph and its conventions
                - Perfect! [*](((JZ5RfJLcK)))
                - "Better to place it under one's daily notes or within the daily log up above?  "
                    - Within your [[DNP Section]] is perfect. The conventions are still kinda emergent for this, but I like how you did it. I see "within your DNP" as a personal log, while pinned to the top as a global log. Central might be better for visibility... will [[sleep on it]].
        3. "Turn off brackets to streamline the look of page looks a bit"
            - {{[[TODO]]}} Find out how to make this the default in the CSS (I know it's possible, maybe within the [[Leyendecker]] code?) [[cc:[[Charles Farr]]]] #[[Week-05: 02-01-2021]]
        4. "#[[Fleeting Notes]] [[tagging]] [[conventions]] should lean on using tag combinations as opposed to compound tags" #Bookmarks
            - Love this! Great direction. Interested in using this idea to sort out a good system for incorporating [[questions]] throughout the graph.
        5. "Allows for seamless inline referencing of Evergreen notes"
            - What determines whether you'd reference the page or the block?
            - My gut seems to lean towards referencing the page inline...
                - I generally prefer the [[linked references]] and [[filtering]] associated with [[pages]] over [[blocks]].
        6. "Added CSS to eliminate the `#Evergreen` from block references, leaving only the icon"
            - This does look nice! 
                - Some reasons for hesitation:
                    - E vs Evergreen vs Evergreen Notes all as active tags feels challenging for [[disambiguation]].
                        - Especially Evergreen vs Evergreen Notes

            - **Definition**: (Logical) structure that could be contained within a single block ((one way to understand this is, using one sentence to conclude what you wanna express)).
            - **Significance**: Based on this semantic, we could design block based CSS, which could convey structure in a visual way. 
            - Example:: Actually, we could think of current `#Fleeting Notes` and `#Evergreen` a kind of "#[[Fleeting Notes]] block-level [[model]]".
            - Example:: Try to think of the following situation, saying that I want to **distinguish two concepts by introducing their difference**.

            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Learning [[collaboration]] requires separate clear shared [[goals]], to enable the process of learning collaboration to serve as a meta-goal
                - Epistemic status:  strongly held belief, shaped by personal experience managing teams and project managing myself on Roam
                - It's hard to have learning to collaborate be the sole goal, as it's then difficult to measure and assess progress.  How do you think about whether one is collaborating enough?  How does one measure success in the collaboration?
                - It's possible that I'm overly anchored on the one Roam Game that's stated re: project management.  In my own experience incorporating Roam into project management, it took some experimentation by thoughtfully asking myself: is this current workflow enabling me to make progress across my multitude of projects?  It wasn't about the workflow in and of itself, but about how the workflow was a tool towards 
                - My working hypothesis is that given how unbounded and malleable Roam is, the ideal project management structure will likely depend greatly on the type of project (e.g., short vs. long, high collaboration vs. separable).  It will be a family of principles, rather than a universal one.  
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Building norms for collaboration in a distributed setting might require very structured initiation, that may feel antithetic to Roam
                - Epistemic status:  intuition that needs to be stress-tested
                - Perhaps I'm overly anchored by recency bias from having read Bret Victor's [Magic Ink](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/) yesterday and the harms of interactivity
                - Within Victor's definition, Roam is clearly a manipulation software and not an information software; but it has an incredible malleability that makes its a multi-purpose tool.  How best to work and shape the tool will depend on the objective.  
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Effective teaming requires clear norms and expectations
                    - Epistemic status:  business truism, true to my experience - but need to think about how a digital environment of loosely connected people may lead to a different definition of "effective", "clear", "norms" and "expectations"

        - ADDRESSED - Are smartblocks working?  Wasn't able to action it for my daily page
        - The "About Roam Collective" page feels hidden - I know it's in the sidebar, but I think it would be quite helpful to have it in the recommended path in the steps to getting started
            - I was struck that the help provided a lot of instructions but I had to go looking for what the mission and goals of the Roam Collective were.  
            - In my initial exploration, I stumbled upon the Projects page because I asked myself if there was one.  I would imagine Projects - defining them as a community and deciding which ones to join as an individual - are a foundational step towards building effective collaboration 
        - Given how unbounded Roam can be, could it be helpful to present the quick steps as a video?
        - WOW - so cool: when a reference appeared to the block I wrote above, a message also appeared noting there was an unread reference 
            - Wonder how this works, and how it might work for blocks with multiple authors (although not sure authorship is tracked as blocks are showing up as "anonymous")
                - Seems like all my unread references are showing up, regardless if its a thread I was reading.  Will see how this looks next time I log in
        - Is there value in adding something like "epistemic status" to fleeting notes - so people know immediately if it's just some spitballing or something more robust?

            - "Excellent documentation on this!! "
                - Added the recommended tags!!
            - "I saw this and love the idea! I've used `Rationale::` with similar purpose on occasion... maybe `Basis::`? I see it as an [[E/optional, but beneficial]] step. "
                - On an optional basis, for those interested in it, I think it could be interesting to develop some shorthands that help indicate both level of confidence and level of evidence.  At least, I think there could be some interesting experimentation around building collective knowledge that build from individual knowledge basis
            - "I'd place this within a Daily Log module instead. "
                - Better to place it under one's daily notes or within the daily log up above?  
                    - Was looking for a polite way to "log off" :) not sure there is a convention for that 
                    - For the specific goal of knowing who is "online" and to facilitate in-roam conversations (such as the one we are having), it could suffice to have a tag to signal that (e.g., "live now" or some other convention).  Then it doesn't have to be up top on the daily note

        - "Check this out, [[~[[Charles Farr]]]] [Namespace choice AoT](((u8etVKAtE)))"
            - [[@[[Brandon Toner]]]] I like the AOT but disagree with the choice!
                - My stance remains that there are a ton of benefits to having an identifier in the actual page title
                - See my [comments yesterday](((dg-k5f3s6))) for some more thoughts on Evergreen notes
        - "#Q How should we disambiguate between the various types of question tags? #Bookmarks [[~[[Charles Farr]]]]"
            - My preference is to limit it to a parent-level tag and then a block level tag
                - This would look like
                    - `#Questions`
                        - `#Q` Why is it important to limit the number of tags used in a graph?
                - Benefits
                    - Limits the cognitive burden associated with tagging correctly
                    - Easily extensible
                        - Add an additional tag to add queryable context
                            - #Questions
                                - #Conventions
                                    - #Q Why is it important to limit the number of tags used in a graph?
                                - #zettelkasten
                                    - #Q How should questions be incorporated in the zettelkasten (e.g., with fleeting, literature, or evergreen notes)
                - Downsides
                    - Context is implicit, not explicit
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[tagging]] [[conventions]] should lean on using tag combinations as opposed to compound tags
                - Tag combinations reduce the total number of tags required of the user to remember â€” easing cognitive burden is helpful during onboarding and can sustain participation
                    - Compound tags almost always have more detailed and specific definitions â€” not easy to pick up rapidly in a large graph
    - #[[Change Log]]
        - Added CSS to eliminate the `#Evergreen` from block references, leaving only the icon
            - See CSS here: "In Block Reference"
            - Example: "#Evergreen Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims"
            - Allows for seamless inline referencing of Evergreen notes
